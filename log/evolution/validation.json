    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBackground\n\n\t\tWhat is the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC)?\n\nThe IDFC is authorized by statute to be a \"wholly owned Government corporation ... under the foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State\" in the executive branch. Its purpose is to \"mobilize and facilitate the participation of private sector capital and skills in the economic development\" of developing and transition countries, in order to complement U.S. development assistance objectives and foreign policy interests (\u00a71412). In other words, the IDFC's mission is to promote private investment in support of both U.S. global development goals and U.S. economic interests. Not yet operational, the IDFC represents a potentially major overhaul of U.S. development finance efforts. \nThe IDFC's enabling legislation is the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 (BUILD Act), which was enacted on October 5, 2018, as Division F of a law to reauthorize the (unrelated) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ( H.R. 302 / P.L. 115-254 ). Under the BUILD Act, the IDFC is to consolidate and expand the U.S. government's existing development finance functions\u2014currently conducted primarily by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). By statute, the IDFC is a successor agency to OPIC, which is to terminate when the IDFC is operational. \n\n\t\tWhat existing agency functions are consolidated?\n\nThe BUILD Act consolidates functions currently carried out primarily by OPIC and certain elements of USAID (see Appendix ). \nThe act established the new IDFC to be a successor entity to OPIC, taking over all of its functions and authorities and adding new ones. The IDFC's authorities would expand beyond OPIC's existing authorities to make loans and guarantees and issue insurance or reinsurance. They would also include the authority to take minority equity positions in investments, subject to limitations. In addition, unlike OPIC, the IDFC would be able to issue loans in local currency.\nThe extent to which USAID functions will be transferred to the new IDFC is less clear. The act specifies that the Development Credit Authority (DCA), the existing legacy credit portfolio under the Urban and Environment Credit Program, and any other direct loan programs and non-DCA guarantee programs shall be transferred to the IDFC. It also provides the authority for, but does not require, the transfer of USAID's Office of Private Capital and Microenterprise, the existing USAID-managed enterprise funds (it gives the IDFC authority to establish new funds), and the sovereign loan guarantee portfolio. The disposition of these functions is to be detailed in the reorganization plan that the Administration must submit to Congress within 120 days of enactment. The reorganization plan is expected to be submitted by early February 2019.\nIn addition, the IDFC would have the authority to conduct feasibility studies on proposed investment projects (with cost sharing) and provide technical assistance.\n\n\t\tWhat is development finance?\n\n\"Development finance\" is a term commonly used to describe government-backed financing to support private sector capital investments in developing and emerging economies. It can be viewed on a continuum of public and private support, situated between pure government support through grants and concessional loans and pure commercial financing at market-rate terms.\nDevelopment finance generally is targeted toward promoting economic development by supporting foreign direct investment (FDI) in underserved types of projects, regions, and countries; undercapitalized sectors; and countries with viable project environments but low credit ratings. Such support is aimed to increase private sector activity and public-private partnerships that would not happen otherwise in the absence of development finance support because of the actual or perceived risk associated with the activity. Tools of development finance may include equity (raising capital through the sale of ownership shares), direct loans, loan guarantees, political risk insurance, and technical assistance.\nDevelopment financing is particularly important for infrastructure funding, where annual global investment in transportation, power, water, and telecommunications systems falls, by one account, almost $800 million short of the estimated $3.3 trillion required to keep pace with projected economic growth. The largest infrastructure investment gaps are in the road and electricity sectors in developing and emerging economies. \n\n\t\tWhat are development finance institutions (DFIs)?\n\nDFIs are specialized entities that supply development finance, generally aiming to be catalytic agents in promoting private sector investment in developing countries. In the United States, OPIC has been the primary DFI since the 1970s. In FY2017, OPIC reported authorizing $3.8 billion in new commitments for 112 projects, and its exposure reached a record high of $23.2 billion (see Figure 1 ). OPIC estimated that it helped mobilize $6.8 billion in capital and supported 13,000 new jobs in host countries that year. Sub-Saharan Africa represents the largest share of OPIC's portfolio by region. OPIC has committed $2.4 billion in financing and political risk insurance for Power Africa\u2212a major public-private partnership coordinated by USAID\u2212to date, including committing $12.4 million for a loan to support construction of a hydropower plant in Uganda in FY2017. Among other focus areas, OPIC currently has $5 billion invested in the Indo-Pacific in projects to expand access to energy, education, and financial services, as well as to support local farmers. On July 30, 2018, OPIC, the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC, Japan's counterpart to OPIC), and the Australian government announced a trilateral partnership to mobilize investments in infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific region to support development, connectivity, and economic growth in the region.\nOther agencies, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), also provide development finance. The IDFC is to take on the DFI mantle for the United States under the BUILD Act. \nAt the bilateral level, national governments can operate DFIs. The United Kingdom was the first country to establish a DFI in 1948. Many countries have followed suit. In the United States, OPIC began operations in 1971, but the U.S. government's role in overseas investment financing predates OPIC's formal establishment. \nBilateral DFIs are typically wholly or majority government-owned. They operate either as independent institutions or as a part of larger development banks or institutions. Their organizational structures have evolved, in some cases, due to changing perceptions of how to address identified development needs in the most effective way possible. Unlike OPIC, other bilateral DFIs tend to be permanent and not subject to renewals by their countries' legislatures.\nDFIs also can operate multilaterally, as parts of international financial institutions (IFIs), such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private-sector arm of the World Bank. They can operate regionally through regional development banks as well. Examples of these banks include the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD), and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).\nDFIs vary in their specific objectives, management structures, authorities, and activities. \n\n\t\tHow does development finance relate to foreign assistance?\n\nHistorically, official development assistance (ODA) has been a primary way that the United States and other developed countries have provided support for infrastructure projects in developing countries. However, foreign aid for infrastructure has declined over decades while the growth of direct private investment flows has outpaced ODA, making development finance an increasingly prominent way to encourage private investment in undercapitalized areas. Private investors face challenges investing in developing countries due to political risk, exchange rate risk, and weaknesses in legal, regulatory, and institutional environments, among other things. In such cases, government support, whether through equity, financing, or political risk insurance, may provide needed liquidity or assurances to catalyze private investment. \n\n\t\tHow does the IDFC aim to respond to China's growing economic influence in developing countries?\n\nWhile it does not mention China by name, the BUILD Act alludes to concerns with state-directed investments, such as China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which launched in 2013. The act states that it is U.S. policy to \"facilitate market-based private sector development and inclusive economic growth in less developed countries\" through financing, including\nto provide countries a robust alternative to state-directed investments by authoritarian governments and [U.S.] strategic competitors using best practices with respect to transparency and environmental and social safeguards, and which take into account the debt sustainability of partner countries (\u00a71411).\nSupporters view the IDFC as a central part of the U.S. response to China's growing economic influence in developing countries, exemplified by the BRI\u2014which could provide, by some estimates, anywhere from $1 trillion to $8 trillion in Chinese investments and development financing for infrastructure projects in developing countries (see text box ). The Administration and many Members of Congress have been critical of China's financing model, which they find to lack transparency, operate under inadequate environmental and social safeguards for projects, and employ questionable lending practices that may lead to unsustainable debt burdens in some poorer countries (so-called \"debt diplomacy\"). Under this view, the IDFC (when operational) may help the United States compete more effectively or strategically with China. While even a strengthened OPIC may not be able to compete \"dollar-for-dollar\" with China's DFI activity, supporters argue that the United States \"can and should do more to support international economic development with partners who have embraced the private sector-driven development model.\" Others, however, argued that the act could have tightened the IDFC's focus with respect to China, for instance, by requiring the IDFC to have a specific focus on countering China's investment and economic influence; from this perspective, the failure to narrow the IDFC's scope makes it likely that the new entity may support projects of limited U.S. foreign policy and strategic interest\u2014a concern that some critics have levied against OPIC. \n\n\tBUILD Act Formulation and Debate\n\n\t\tWhat is the BUILD Act's legislative history?15\n\nIn February 2018, two proposed versions of the BUILD Act, H.R. 5105 in the House and S. 2463 in the Senate, were introduced to create a new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC). Both bills proposed consolidating all of OPIC's functions and certain elements of USAID\u2014including the Development Credit Authority (DCA), Office of Private Capital and Microenterprise, and enterprise funds. A major difference between the two bills, as introduced, was that H.R. 5105 would have authorized the IDFC for seven years, while S. 2463 would have authorized it for two decades, until September 30, 2038. The House-passed version (July 17, 2018; H.Rept. 115-814 ) and Senate committee-reported version (June 27, 2018) bridged some differences, including both providing a seven-year authorization. \nOn September 26, 2018, the House adopted a resolution ( H.Res. 1082 ) to pass the BUILD Act as part of the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2018 (FAA Reauthorization Act; H.R. 302 ). The Senate followed with its passage of the BUILD Act as part of the FAA Reauthorization Act on October 3, 2018. On October 5, 2018, the President signed into law the FAA Reauthorization Act, with the BUILD Act in Division F. \n\n\t\tWhat is the Trump Administration's development finance policy approach?\n\nAlthough the President's FY2018 budget request called for eliminating OPIC's funding as part of its critical view of U.S. government agencies with international development orientations, the Administration ultimately pursued development finance reform through OPIC as an opportunity to respond to China's growing economic influence in developing countries. The Trump Administration included development finance consolidation in its FY2019 budget request and subsequent set of government-wide reorganization proposals. The Administration supported the BUILD Act bills introduced in Congress ( H.R. 5105 , S. 2320 ), viewing them as broadly consistent with its goals, while calling for some modifications. It later said that amendments to the BUILD Act fulfilled the Administration's goals, including to \"align U.S. government development finance with broader foreign policy and development goals, enhancing the competitiveness and compatibility of the U.S. development finance toolkit.\"\n\n\t\tWhat was the policy debate over the BUILD Act?\n\nThe BUILD Act follows long-standing debate among policymakers over whether or not government financing of private-sector activity is appropriate. Supporters argued that OPIC helps fill in gaps in private-sector support that arise from market failures and helps U.S. firms compete against foreign firms backed by foreign DFIs for investment opportunities\u2014thereby advancing U.S. foreign policy, national security, and economic interests. Various civil society stakeholders have proposed consolidating the development finance functions of OPIC and other agencies into a new DFI in order to boost OPIC and make U.S. development finance efforts more competitive with those of foreign countries. Opponents held that OPIC diverts capital away from efficient uses and crowds out private alternatives, criticized OPIC for assuming risks unwanted by the private sector, and questioned the development benefits of its programs. They have called for terminating OPIC's functions or privatizing them.\nWhile the BUILD Act garnered overall support, specific aspects of it were subject to debate. Some development advocates expressed concern that the BUILD Act's transfer of DCA and other credit program authority from USAID to the IDFC may sever the close link between these funding mechanisms and the USAID development programs into which they have been embedded, potentially making the tools less effective and less development-oriented. Others saw potential for the DCA to become a more robust financing option for USAID programs under the new IDFC, with its expanded authorities. In response to these concerns, the BUILD Act includes many provisions, discussed later in this report, to promote coordination and linkages between USAID and the IDFC, and to emphasize the development mission of the IDFC. Some in the development community also questioned whether the new DFI would have a sufficiently strong development mandate, as well as raised concerns about the transparency, environmental, and social standards of the new DFI relative to OPIC. Some critics of OPIC supported strengthening statutorily the aim of the IDFC in specifically countering China's influence in the developing countries. Other possible policy alternatives include focusing on enhancing coordination of development finance functions among agencies or supporting development goals through multilateral and regional DFIs in which the United States plays a major leadership role.\n\n\tIDFC Organizational Structure and Management\n\nWhile the IDFC authorized by the BUILD Act has yet to be established, and some implementation questions remain, the act detailed many aspects of how the new entity should be structured, managed, and overseen by Congress. This section discusses the BUILD Act provisions that describe how the new IDFC is expected to function once established. \n\n\t\tWhat are the congressional committees of jurisdiction?\n\nThe BUILD Act defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" as the Senate Foreign Relations and Appropriations committees and the House Foreign Affairs and Appropriations committees (\u00a71402(1)). It imposes a number of reporting and notification requirements on the IDFC with respect to these congressional committees. These committees have typically been the same ones in which legislation related to OPIC and USAID is introduced. \n\n\t\tWhat is the IDFC's mission?\n\nThe BUILD Act establishes the IDFC for the stated purpose of mobilizing private-sector capital and skills for the economic benefit of less-developed countries, as well as countries in transition from nonmarket to market economies, in support of U.S. development assistance and other foreign policy objectives (\u00a71412(b)). This is very similar to the mission of OPIC, as described in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. \nThe legislation includes several provisions intended to ensure that the corporation remains focused on this development mission. The act directs the IDFC to prioritize support to countries with low-income or lower-middle-income economies, establishes a position of Chief Development Officer on the board, and requires that a performance measurement system be developed that includes, among other things, standards and methods for ensuring the development performance of the corporation's portfolio. The annual report required by the BUILD Act also must include an analysis of the desired development outcomes for IDFC-supported projects and the extent to which the corporation is meeting associated development metrics, goals, and objectives.\n\n\t\tHow will the IDFC be managed?\n\nThe BUILD Act establishes a Board of Directors (\"Board\"), a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), a Deputy Chief Executive Officer (Deputy CEO), a Chief Risk Officer, a Chief Development Officer, and any other officers as the Board may determine, to manage the IDFC (\u00a71413(a)). \nThe BUILD Act vests all powers of the IDFC in the nine-member Board of Directors (\u00a71413(b)). By statute, the Board is composed of\na C hief Executive Officer ; four U.S. government officials \u2014the Secretary of State, USAID Administrator, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of Commerce (or their designees); and four non government members appointed by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, with \"relevant experience\" to carry out the IDFC's purpose, which \"may include experience relating to the private sector, the environment, labor organizations, or international development.\" These members have three-year terms, can be reappointed for one additional term, and serve until their successors are appointed and confirmed. \nThe Board's Chairperson is the Secretary of State and the Vice Chairperson is the USAID Administrator (or their designees). \nThe Board differs in size and potentially composition from that of OPIC's Board. By statute, OPIC's 15-member Board of Directors is composed of eight \"private sector\" Directors, with specific requirements for representation of small business, labor, and cooperatives interests, and seven \"federal government\" Directors (including the OPIC President, USAID Administrator, U.S. Trade Representative, and a Labor Department officer). The President of the United States appoints the Board Chairman and Vice Chairman from among the members of the Board.\nFive members of the Board constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. The Board is required to hold at least two public hearings each year to allow for stakeholder input. \n\n\t\tWhat will be the responsibilities of the officers?\n\nThe BUILD Act establishes four officers for IDFC management. A Chief Executive Officer, who is under the Board's direct authority, is responsible for the IDFC's management and exercising powers and duties as the Board directs (\u00a71413(d)). The BUILD Act also establishes a Deputy Chief Executive Officer (\u00a71413(e)). The Chief Executive Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer are appointed by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and serve at the pleasure of the President.\nThe act outlines the positions of the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Development Officer in more detail. Both officers are to be appointed by the CEO, subject to Board approval, from among individuals with senior-level experience in financial risk management and development, respectively. They each are to report directly to the Board and are removable only by a majority Board vote. The Chief Risk Officer, in coordination with the Audit Committee established by the act, is responsible for developing, implementing, and managing a comprehensive process for identifying, assessing, monitoring, and limiting risks to the IDFC (\u00a71413(f)). The Chief Development Officer's responsibilities include coordinating the IDFC's development policies and implementation efforts with USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and other relevant U.S. government departments and agencies; managing IDFC employees dedicated to working on transactions and projects codesigned with USAID and other relevant U.S. government entities; and authorizing and coordinating interagency transfers of funds and resources to support the IDFC (\u00a71413(g)). OPIC's enabling legislation does not include either a specific Chief Risk Officer or Chief Development Officer. \n\n\t\tWill the IDFC have any advisory support?\n\nThe BUILD Act establishes a Development Advisory Council to advise the Board on the IDFC's development objectives (\u00a71413(i)). By statute, its members are Board-appointed on the recommendation of the CEO and Chief Development Officer, and composed of no more than nine members \"broadly representative\" of NGOs and other international development-related institutions. Its functions are to advise the Board on the extent to which the IDFC is meeting its development mandate and any suggestions for improvements.\n\n\t\tWhat oversight structures will the IDFC have?\n\nThe BUILD Act establishes several oversight structures to govern the agency overall and particular aspects.\nUnlike OPIC, which is overseen by the USAID Inspector General, the IDFC is to have its own Inspector General (IG) (\u00a71414) to conduct reviews, investigations, and inspections of its operations and activities. In addition, the act requires the Board to establish a \"transparent and independent accountability mechanism\" to annually evaluate and report to the Board and Congress regarding statutory compliance with environmental, social, labor, human rights, and transparency standards; provide a forum for resolving concerns regarding the impacts of specific IDFC-supported projects with respect to such standards; and provide advice regarding IDFC projects, policies, and practices (\u00a71415). \nThe BUILD Act also requires the IDFC to establish a Risk Committee and Audit Committee to ensure monitoring and oversight of the IDFC's investment strategies and finances (\u00a71441). Both committees are under the direction of the Board. The Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the formulation of the IDFC's risk governance structure and risk profile (e.g., strategic, reputational, regulatory, operational, developmental, environmental, social, and financial risks) (\u00a71441(b)), while the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the IDFC's financial performance management structure, including the integrity of its internal controls and financial statements, the performance of internal audits, and compliance with legal and regulatory finance-related requirements (\u00a71444(c)).\n\n\tIDFC Operations\n\n\t\tFor what purposes can the IDFC use its authorities?\n\nIn general, the IDFC's authorities are limited to (\u00a71421(a)) \ncarrying out U.S. policy and the IDFC's purpose, as outlined in the statute; mitigating risks to U.S. taxpayers by sharing risks with the private sector and qualifying sovereign entities through cofinancing and structuring of tools; and ensuring that support provided is \"additional\" to private-sector resources by mobilizing private capital that would otherwise not be deployed without such support. \nThe emphasis on additionality reflects OPIC's current policy, but is not explicitly in OPIC's enabling legislation. Policymakers have debated whether OPIC supports or crowds out private-sector activity.\n\n\t\tWhat financial authorities and tools will the IDFC have?\n\nUnder the BUILD Act, the IDFC's authorities would expand beyond OPIC's existing authorities to make loans and guarantees and issue insurance or reinsurance (see Table 1 ). They would also include the authority to take minority equity positions in investments. USAID-drawn authorities include technical assistance and the establishment of enterprise funds. In addition, the IDFC would have the authority to conduct feasibility studies on proposed investment projects (with cost-sharing) and provide technical assistance. A chart depicting the current development finance functions of relevant U.S. agencies, as well as how those functions may be shifted by the BUILD Act, is in the Appendix .\nThe IDFC's functions are discussed below.\nLoan and Guarantees. The IDFC is authorized to make loans or guarantees upon the terms and conditions that it determines (\u00a71421(b)). Loans and guarantees are subject to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA). \nIDFC financing may be denominated and repayable in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, the latter only in cases where the Board determines there is a \"substantive policy rationale.\" This is distinct from OPIC, which is limited to making loans in U.S. currency.\nEquity Investments. The BUILD Act authorizes the IDFC to take equity stakes in private investments (\u00a71421(c)). The IDFC can support projects as a minority investor acquiring equity or quasiequity stake of any entity, including as a limited partner or other investor in investment funds, upon such terms and conditions as the IDFC may determine. Loans and guarantees may be denominated and repayable in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, the latter only in cases where the Board determines there is a \"substantive policy rationale.\" The IDFC is required to develop guidelines and criteria to require that the use of equity authority has a clearly defined development and foreign policy purpose, taking into account certain factors. \nThe BUILD Act places limitations on equity investment, both in terms of the specific project and the overall support. The total amount of support with respect to any project cannot exceed 30% of the total amount of all equity investment made to that project at the time the IDFC approves support. Furthermore, equity support is limited to no more than 35% of the IDFC's total exposure. The BUILD Act directs the IDFC to sell and liquidate its equity investment support as soon as commercially feasible commensurate with other similar investors in the project, taking into account national security interests of the United States.\nThe addition of equity authority is potentially significant. OPIC does not have the capacity to make equity investments; it can only provide debt financing as a senior lender, meaning it is repaid first in the event of a loss. Foreign DFIs often have been reluctant to partner with OPIC because they would prefer to be on an equal footing. Potential expansion of OPIC's equity authority capability has met resistance from some Members of Congress in the past, based on discomfort with the notion of the U.S. government acquiring ownership stakes in private investments, among other concerns. \nInsurance and r einsurance . The IDFC may issue insurance or reinsurance to private-sector entities and qualifying sovereign entities assuring protection of their investments in whole or in part against political risks (\u00a71421(d)). Examples include currency inconvertibility and transfer restrictions, expropriation, war, terrorism, civil disturbance, breach of contract, or non-honoring of financial obligations.\nInvestment promotion . The IDFC is authorized to initiate and support feasibility studies for planning, developing, and managing of and procurement for potential bilateral and multilateral development projects eligible for support (\u00a71421(e)). This includes training on how to identify, assess, survey, and promote private investment opportunities. The BUILD Act directs the IDFC, to the maximum extent practicable, to require cost-sharing by those receiving funds for investment promotion.\nSpecial projects and programs. The IDFC is authorized to administer and manage special projects and programs to support specific transactions, including financial and advisory support programs that provide private technical, professional, or managerial assistance in the development of human resources, skills, technology, capital savings, or intermediate financial and investment institutions or cooperatives (\u00a71421(f)). This includes the initiation of incentives, grants, or studies for the energy sector, women's economic empowerment, microenterprise households, or other small business activities.\nEnterprise funds. The BUILD Act authorizes but does not require the transfer of existing USAID enterprise funds to the IDFC (\u00a71421(g)). Existing Europe/Eurasia enterprise funds are winding down. The two newer funds, in Tunisia and Egypt, remain primarily funded by U.S. government grant funds and are private sector-managed, arguably requiring close USAID oversight and an in-country presence to ensure the funds fulfill a development, rather than a purely for-profit, mission. As such, their removal to an agency without either feature may make this model less effective as a development instrument. The BUILD Act also gives the IDFC authority to establish new enterprise funds. It has been argued, however, that the IDFC's authority to conduct equity investment would make enterprise funds unnecessary.\n\n\t\tWill the IDFC's activities have U.S. government backing?\n\nAll of the IDFC's authorities, like prior support by OPIC and USAID components, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. In other words, the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is pledged for full payment and performance of obligations under these authorities (\u00a71434(e)). \n\n\t\tWill the IDFC have an exposure limit?\n\nThe maximum contingent liability (overall portfolio) that the IDFC can have outstanding at any one time cannot exceed $60 billion (\u00a71433). This is more than double OPIC's current exposure limit\u2014$29 billion. In recent years, OPIC support has reached record highs\u2014totaling $23.2 billion in FY2017. While the IDFC's exposure cap is small compared to the potentially trillions of dollars that China is pouring into development efforts like the BRI, supporters argue that the IDFC could catalyze other private investment to developing countries through the U.S. development finance model. \n\n\t\tHow will the IDFC be funded?\n\nAccording to the BUILD Act, the IDFC will be funded through a Corporate Capital Account comprised of fees for services, interest earnings, returns on investments, and transfers of unexpended balances from predecessor agencies (\u00a71434). Annual appropriations legislation will designate a portion of these funds that may be retained for operating and program expenses, while the rest will revert to the Treasury, much like the current OPIC funding process. Like OPIC, the new IDFC is expected to be self-sustaining, meaning that anticipated collections are expected to exceed expenses, resulting in a net gain to the Treasury. The act also authorizes transfers of funds appropriated to USAID and the State Department to the IDFC. This authority will allow USAID missions and bureaus to continue to fund DCA activities related to their projects through transfers, as they now do through transfers to the DCA office within USAID. \nThe BUILD Act does not authorize annual appropriations levels for administrative and program expenses for the new IDFC, and it is unclear how future appropriations provisions for the IDFC will compare to current OPIC and DCA provisions. In FY2018, appropriators made $79.2 million of OPIC revenue available for OPIC's administrative expenses and $20 million available for loans and loan guarantees. DCA was appropriated $10 million for administrative expenses and authorized to use up to $55 million transferred from foreign assistance accounts managed by USAID to support loan guarantees. \n\n\t\tHow are losses to be repaid?\n\nIn general, if the IDFC determines that the holder of a loan guaranteed by the IDFC suffers a loss as a result of default by the loan borrower, the IDFC shall pay to the holder the percentage of loss per contract after the holder of the loan has made further collection efforts and instituted any required enforcement proceedings (\u00a71423). The IDFC also must institute recovery efforts on the borrower. The BUILD Act puts limitations on the payment of losses, such as generally limiting it to the dollar value of tangible or intangible contributions or commitments made in the project plus interest, earnings, or profits actually accrued on such contributions or commitments to the extent provided by such insurance, reinsurance, or guarantee. The Attorney General must take action as may be appropriate to enforce any right accruing to the United States as a result of the issuance of any loan or guarantee under this title. The BUILD Act also imposes certain limitations on payments of losses.\n\n\t\tFor how long is the IDFC authorized?\n\nThe BUILD Act provides that the IDFC's authorities terminate seven years after the date of the enactment of the act (\u00a71424). It also provides that the IDFC terminates on the date on which its portfolio is liquidated. This is markedly different from the annual extensions of authority required for OPIC in recent years. A longer-term authorization as given to the IDFC could be beneficial for supporting investments in infrastructure projects, which often are multiyear endeavors, as well as underscore a sustained U.S. commitment to respond to China's BRI.\n\n\tStatutory Parameters for IDFC Project Support\n\n\t\tWill there be terms and conditions of IDFC support?\n\nThe BUILD Act authorizes the IDFC to set terms and conditions for its support, subject to certain parameters.\nReason for support. The IDFC is only permitted to provide its support if it is necessary either to alleviate a credit market imperfection or to achieve a specified goal of U.S. development or foreign policy by providing support in the most efficient way to meet those objectives on a case-by-case basis (\u00a71422(b)(1)).\nLength of support. The final maturity of a loan or guarantee cannot exceed 25 years or the debt servicing capabilities of the project to be financed by the loan, whichever is lesser (\u00a71422(b)(2)). \nRisk-sharing. With respect to any loan guarantee to a project, the IDFC must require parties to bear the risk of loss in an amount equal to at least 20% of the guaranteed support by the IDFC to the project (\u00a71422(b)(3))\u2014compared to 50% risk-sharing in most cases for OPIC. \nU.S. financial interest. The IDFC may not make a guarantee or loan unless it determines that the borrower or lender is responsible and that adequate provision is made for servicing the loan on reasonable terms and protecting the U.S. financial interest (\u00a71422(b)(4)).\nInterest rate. The interest rate for direct loans and interest supplements on guaranteed loans shall be set by reference to a benchmark interest rate (yield) on marketable Treasury securities or other widely recognized or appropriate comparable benchmarks, as determined in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury. The IDFC must establish appropriate minimum interest rates for loan guarantees, and other instruments as necessary. The minimum interest rate for new loans must be adjusted periodically to account for changes in the interest rate of the benchmark financial interest (\u00a71422(b)(5) and (6)).\nFees and premiums. The IDFC must set fees or premiums for support at levels that minimize U.S. government cost while supporting the achievement of objectives for that support. The IDFC must review fees for loan guarantees periodically to ensure that fees on new loan guarantees are at a level sufficient to cover the IDFC's most recent estimates of its cost (\u00a71422(b)(7)).\nBudget authority. The IDFC may not make loans or loan guarantees except to the extent that budget authority to cover their costs is provided in advance in an appropriations act (\u00a71422(b)(10)).\nStandards. The IDFC must prescribe explicit standards for use in periodically assessing the credit risk of new and existing direct loans or guaranteed loans. It also must rely upon specific standards to assess the developmental and strategic value of projects for which it provides support and should only provide the minimum level of support needed to support such projects (\u00a71422(b)(9) and (11)).\nSeniority. Any loan or guarantee by the IDFC is to be on a senior basis or pari passu with other senior debt unless there is a substantive policy rationale for otherwise (\u00a71422(b)(12)). \n\n\t\tIn which countries can the IDFC operate?\n\nIn general, the IDFC is to prioritize support for less-developed countries (i.e., with a \"low-income economy or a lower-middle-income economy\"), as defined by the World Bank (\u00a71402 and \u00a71411). It must restrict support in less-developed countries with \"upper-middle-income economies\" unless (1) the President certifies to Congress that such support furthers U.S. national economic or foreign policy interests; and (2) such support is designed to have \"significant development outcomes or provide developmental benefits to the poorest population\" of that country (\u00a71412). This arguably narrows the IDFC's focus to low-income and lower-middle-income countries, compared to OPIC's statutory requirements and practice.\nThe IDFC may provide support in any country the government of which has entered into an agreement with the United States authorizing the IDFC to provide support (\u00a71431).\n\n\t\tWhat considerations will factor into the IDFC's decision to support projects?\n\nPreference for U.S. sponsors. The IDFC must give preferential consideration to projects sponsored by or involving private-sector entities that are \"U.S. persons\"\u2014defined as either U.S. citizens or entities owned or controlled by U.S. citizens (\u00a71451(b)). This presumably eases OPIC's requirement for projects to have a \"U.S. connection\" based on U.S. citizenship or U.S. ownership shares; the particular requirements vary by program. This change arguably opens up the possibility that the IDFC could support investments by foreign project sponsors, assuming they meet other statutory requirements.\nPreference for countries in compliance with i nternational trade obligations . The IDFC must consult at least annually with the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) regarding countries' eligibility for IDFC support and compliance with international trade obligations (\u00a71451(c)). The IDFC must give preferential consideration to countries in compliance with (or making substantial progress in coming into compliance with) their international trade obligations. While OPIC does not have a comparable obligation, the USTR (or a designated Deputy USTR) is a member of OPIC's Board of Directors. \nWorker rights. The IDFC can only support projects in countries taking steps to adopt and implement laws that extend internationally recognized worker rights (as defined in \u00a7507 of the Trade Act of 1974, 19 U.S.C. 2467) to workers in that country. It must include specified language in all contracts for support regarding worker rights and child labor (\u00a71451(d)). These provisions appear to be similar to OPIC's requirements in terms of worker rights.\nEnvironmental and social impact. The Board is prohibited from voting in favor of any project that is likely to have \"significant adverse environmental or social impact impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented\" unless it provides an impact notification (\u00a71451(e)). The act requires that (1) the notification be at least 60 days before the date of the Board vote and take the form of an environmental and social impact assessment or initial audit; (2) the notification be made available to the U.S. public and locally affected groups and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the host country; and (3) the IDFC include provisions in any contract relating to the project to ensure mitigation of any such adverse environmental or social impacts. OPIC's enabling legislation has substantially similar requirements as the IDFC's first two requirements with respect to environmental and social impacts.\nWomen's economic empowerment consideration. The IDFC must consider the impact of its support on women's economic opportunities and outcomes and take steps to reduce gender gaps and maximize development impact by working to improve women's economic opportunities (\u00a71451(f)). This is distinct from OPIC's statutory requirements.\nC ountries embracing private enterprise. The IDFC is directed to give preferential consideration to projects for which support may be provided in countries whose governments have demonstrated \"consistent support for economic policies that promote the development of private enterprise, both domestic and foreign, and maintain the conditions that enable private enterprise to make full contribution to the development of such countries\" (\u00a71451(g)). The BUILD Act gives examples of market-based economic policies, protection of private property rights, respect for rule of law, and systems to combat corruption and bribery. OPIC's private enterprise-related requirement appears to be more limited. \nSmall business support. The IDFC must, using broad criteria, to the maximum extent possible, give preferential consideration to supporting projects sponsored by or involving small business, and ensure that small business-related projects are not less than 50% of all projects for which the IDFC provides support and that involve U.S. persons (\u00a71451(i)). OPIC's small business support requirement has a 30% target. \n\n\t\tWhat limitations will there be on the IDFC's support?\n\nLimitation on support for a single entity. No entity receiving IDFC support may receive more than an amount equal to 5% of the IDFC's maximum contingent liability (\u00a71451(a)). In comparison, OPIC has specific limitations by program; for example, no more than 10% of maximum contingent liability of investment insurance can be issued to a single investor, and no more than 15% of maximum contingent liability of investment guarantees can be issued to a single investor.\nBoycott restriction. When considering whether to approve a project, the IDFC must take into account whether the project is sponsored by or substantially affiliated with any individual involved in boycotting a country that is \"friendly\" with the United States and is not subject to a boycott under U.S. law or regulation (\u00a71451(h)). The measure is aimed at ensuring that beneficiaries of the new DFI's support are \"not undermining [U.S.] foreign policy goals.\" Concerns about boycotts against Israel appear to figure prominently. \nInternational terrorism/human rights violations restriction . The IDFC is prohibited from providing support for a government or entity owned or controlled by a government if the Secretary of State has determined that the government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism or has engaged in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights (\u00a71453(a)). In comparison, OPIC must take into account human rights considerations in conducting its programs.\nSanctions restriction. The IDFC is also prohibited from all dealings related to any project prohibited under U.S. sanctions laws or regulations, including dealings with persons on the list of specially designated persons and blocked persons maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury, except to the extent otherwise authorized by the Secretaries of the Treasury or State (\u00a71453(b) and (c)). OPIC is subject to sanctions restrictions as well.\n\n\t\tWhat requirements will the IDFC have to avoid market distortion?\n\nCommercial banks can provide financing for foreign investment, such as through project finance, and political risk insurance. The BUILD Act requires that before the IDFC provides support, it must ensure that private-sector entities are afforded an opportunity to support the project. The IDFC must develop safeguards, policies, and guidelines to ensure that its support supplements and encourages, but does not compete with, private-sector support; operates according to internationally recognized best practices and standards to avoid market-distorting government subsidies and crowding out of private-sector lending; and does not have significant adverse impact on U.S. employment (\u00a71452).\n\n\tMonitoring and Transparency\n\n\t\tWhat performance measures and evaluation will the IDFC have?\n\nThe BUILD Act requires the IDFC to develop a performance measurement system to evaluate and monitor its projects and to guide future project support, using OPIC's current development impact measurement system as a starting point (\u00a71442). The IDFC must develop standards for measuring the projected and ex post development impact of a project. It also must regularly make information about its performance available to the public on a country-by-country basis. \nMeasuring development impact can be complicated for a number of reasons, including definitional issues, difficulties isolating the impact of development finance from other variables that affect development outcome, challenges in monitoring projects for development impact after DFI support for a project ends, and resource constraints. Comparing development impacts across DFIs is also difficult as development indicators may not be harmonized. To the extent that the proposed DFI raises questions within the development community about whether it would be truly \"developmental\" at its core, rigorous adherence to development objectives through a measurement system will likely be critical to gauging its effectiveness. Moreover, Congress may choose to take a broader view of U.S. development impact, given the active U.S. contributions to regional and multilateral DFIs. \n\n\t\tWhat are the IDFC's reporting and notification requirements?\n\nAt the end of each fiscal year, the IDFC must submit to Congress a report including an assessment of its economic and social development impact, the extent to which its operations complement or are compatible with U.S. development assistance programs and those of qualifying sovereign entities, and the compliance of projects with statutory requirements (\u00a71443). In addition, no later than 15 days before the IDFC makes a financial commitment over $10 million, the Chief Executive Officer must submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report with information on the financial commitment (\u00a71446(a) and (b)). The CEO also must notify the committees no later than 30 days after entering into a new bilateral agreement (\u00a71446(c)). \n\n\t\tWhat information must it make available to the public?\n\nThe IDFC must \"maintain a user-friendly, publicly available, machine-readable database with detailed project-level information,\" including description of support provided, annual report information provided to Congress, and project-level performance metrics, along with a \"clear link to information on each project\" online (\u00a71444).\nThe new agency also must cooperate with USAID to engage with investors to develop a strategic relationship \"focused at the nexus of business opportunities and development priorities\" (\u00a71445). This includes IDFC actions to develop risk mitigation tools and provide transaction-structuring support for blending finance models (generally referring to the strategic use of public or philanthropic capital to catalyze private-sector investment for development purposes). \n\n\tImplementation\n\n\t\tHow and when is the IDFC expected to become operational?\n\nThe BUILD Act requires the President to submit to Congress within 120 days of enactment a reorganization plan that details the transfer of agencies, personnel, assets, and obligations to the IDFC. The reorganization plan is expected to be submitted by early February 2019.\nThe President must consult with Congress on the plan not less than 15 days before the date on which the plan is transmitted, and before making any material modification or revision to the plan before it becomes operational.\nThe reorganization plan becomes effective for the IDFC on the date specified in the plan, which may not be earlier than 90 days after the President has transmitted the reorganization plan to Congress (\u00a71462(e)). The actual transfer of functions may occur only after the OPIC President and CEO and the USAID Administrator jointly submit to the foreign affairs committees a report on coordination, including a detailed description of the procedures to be followed after the transfer of functions to coordinate between the IDFC and USAID (\u00a71462(c)). During the transition period, OPIC and USAID are to continue to perform their existing functions. \nThus, the IDFC could become operational as early as summer 2019 based on this timeline ( Figure 2 ). OPIC anticipates that the IDFC could become operational as of October 1, 2019. At that time, OPIC is to be terminated and its enabling legislation is to be repealed (\u00a71464). \n\n\t\tHow will the IDFC relate to other U.S. trade and investment promotion efforts?\n\nThe IDFC is to replace OPIC, and, as such, would be among other federal entities that play a role in promoting U.S. trade and investment efforts. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) provides direct loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance to support U.S. exports, in order to support U.S. jobs. The Trade and Development Agency (TDA) aims to link U.S. businesses to export opportunities in overseas infrastructure and other development projects, in order to support economic growth in these overseas markets. TDA provides funding for project preparation activities, such as feasibility studies, and partnership building, such as reverse trade missions bringing foreign decisionmakers to the United States. The IDFC's authority to conduct feasibility studies and provide other forms of technical assistance has raised questions about overlap with the functions of TDA, but BUILD Act supporters note that while functions may overlap, they will be for different purposes\u2014supporting U.S. investment abroad in the case of the IDFC and supporting U.S. exports in the case of TDA. \nThere may also be some overlap of function between the IDFC and USAID if the reorganization plan calls for the transfer of the Office of Private Capital and Microenterprise from USAID to the IDFC and the IDFC starts its own microfinance programs, as microfinance activities are integrated throughout USAID and would not cease with the transfer of the office. Similarly, if the IDFC uses its authority to create new enterprise funds while declining to transfer existing funds under USAID authority, there may be some overlap in that authority as well.\n\n\tIssues for the 116th Congress\n\nThe 116 th Congress will have responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the BUILD Act, including review of the reorganization plan, the transition it prescribes, and impact on U.S. foreign policy objectives. As part of this process, Congress may consider a number of policy issues, including the following: \nIs the Administration meeting the implementation requirements of the BUILD Act? Does the reorganization plan reflect congressional intent, and are the choices made within the discretion allowed by the BUILD Act justified? How can the IDFC best balance its mission to support U.S. businesses in competing for overseas investment opportunities with its development mandate? What are the policy trade-offs associated with the capacity limits, authorities, policy parameters, and other features formulated by Congress in the BUILD Act? Does the legislation find the right balance, or does the implementation process identify areas where legislative changes might be beneficial? In creating the BUILD Act, Congress gave great consideration to strategic foreign policy concerns. In addition to providing commercial opportunities for U.S. firms, development finance may shape how countries connect to the rest of the world through ports, roads, and other transportation and technological links, providing footholds for the United States to advance its approaches to regulations and standards. Another potential role for development finance is to provide a means to spread U.S. values on governance, transparency, and environmental and social safeguards. Does the current statutory framework enable the IDFC to respond effectively to U.S. strategic concerns, particularly with regard to China's BRI? More fundamentally, is the IDFC's aim to compete with, contain, or counter the BRI and Chinese world vision it represents? Beyond establishing the IDFC, Congress may consider whether to advocate for creating international \"rules for the road\" for development finance. Such rules could help ensure that the IDFC operates on a \"level playing field\" relative to its counterparts, given the variation in terms, conditions, and practices of DFIs internationally. U.S. involvement in developing such rules could help advance U.S. strategic interests. However, such rules would only be effective to the extent that major suppliers of development finance are willing to abide by them. For example, China is not a party to international rules on export credit financing, though it has been involved in recent negotiations to develop new rules on such financing. Should Congress press the Administration to pursue international rules on development finance? Is it feasible to engage China in this regard? \n\n\t\tAppendix. Reorganization of U.S. Government Development and/or Finance Functions\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "Members of Congress and Administrations have periodically considered reorganizing the federal government's trade and development functions to advance various U.S. policy objectives. The Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 (BUILD Act), which was signed into law on October 5, 2018 (P.L. 115-254), represents a potentially major overhaul of U.S. development finance efforts. It establishes a new agency\u2014the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC)\u2014by consolidating and expanding existing U.S. government development finance functions, which are conducted primarily by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and some components of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\nWhile the IDFC is expected to carry over OPIC's authorities and many of its policies, there are some key distinctions. For example, in comparison to OPIC, the new IDFC, by statute, is to have the following:\nMore \"tools\" to provide investment support (e.g., authority to make limited equity investments and provide technical assistance). More capacity (a $60 billion exposure cap compared to OPIC's $29 billion exposure cap). A longer authorization period (seven years compared to OPIC's year-to-year authorization through appropriations legislation in recent years). More specific oversight and risk management (including its own Inspector General [IG], compared to OPIC, which is under the USAID IG's jurisdiction).\nA key policy rationale for the BUILD Act was to respond to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and China's growing economic influence in developing countries. In this regard, the IDFC aims to advance U.S. influence in developing countries by incentivizing private investment as an alternative to a state-directed investment model. The BUILD Act also aims to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of U.S. government development finance functions, as well as to achieve greater cost savings through consolidation.\nThe BUILD Act requires the Administration to submit to Congress a reorganization plan within 120 days of enactment of the act, and the IDFC is not permitted to become operational any sooner than 90 days after the President has transmitted the reorganization plan.\nThe 116th Congress will have responsibility for overseeing the Administration's implementation of the BUILD Act. As the IDFC is operationalized, Members of Congress may examine whether the current statutory framework allows the IDFC to balance both its mandates to support U.S. businesses in competing for overseas investment opportunities and to support development, as well as whether it enables the IDFC to respond effectively to strategic concerns especially vis-\u00e0-vis China. Congress also may consider whether to press the Administration to pursue international rules on development finance comparable to those that govern export credit financing. More broadly, the IDFC's establishment could renew legislative debate over the economic and policy benefits and costs of U.S. government activity to support private investment, and whether such activity is an effective way to promote broad U.S. foreign policy objectives.",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nIntroduction\n\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was created by the 1996 welfare reform law, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-193 ). It replaced the program of cash assistance for needy families that dated back to the New Deal, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and some of its related programs. The enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law was the culmination of a debate about how to overhaul programs providing cash assistance to needy families with children\u2014specifically, those headed by single mothers\u2014that spanned four decades: from the 1960s to the 1990s.\nThe 1996 welfare law provided both program authority and funding (appropriations) for TANF through the end of FY2002. Most of the legislative activity on TANF since 2002 has been to extend the program funding and financing authority for TANF. Most of these extensions did not change TANF policy, though policy changes were included in extensions enacted in 2006, 2010, and 2012. The TANF Extension Act of 2019 ( P.L. 116-4 ) extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019.\nThis report will begin with a brief overview of the history of the AFDC program and the welfare reform debates of the 1960s to the 1990s. That overview will be followed by a summary of the 1996 welfare reform law and the changes made since 1996. The report concludes with a detailed chronology of TANF legislation.\n\n\tBrief History of AFDC and the Welfare Reform Debates\n\nThe modern form of cash assistance for needy families with children dates back to the Progressive Era of the early 1900s, and state- or locally funded mothers' pensions for \"fatherless\" families. The purpose of these programs was to permit these mothers to stay at home and care for their children. \nFederal funding for these programs was first provided in the Social Security Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-271) through the Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) program, later renamed the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC). Many of the later changes, and the welfare reform debates of the 1960s to the 1990s, focused on issues of work and whether providing cash to nonworking single mothers served as disincentives for both work and marriage. \nHowever, the history of the ADC/AFDC program touched many other facets of the well-being of children and their families. ADC/AFDC provided federal funding for social services, medical assistance, child care, and foster care. These were later spun off into separate programs, with dedicated federal funding. While much of the focus of the welfare reform debates was on the single mother (custodial parent), ADC/AFDC policy also touched on noncustodial parents. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program was created, in great part, to reimburse states and the federal government for the costs of providing assistance to single mothers, and making noncustodial fathers responsible for these costs. CSE has evolved into a program that distributes child support payments collected from noncustodial parents to custodial parents, mostly to families that have never received or are no longer receiving cash assistance.\n\n\t\tThe Early Years: 1930s to mid-1950s\n\nThe Social Security Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-271) created the social insurance programs of Old Age Benefits and unemployment compensation, where workers earned protection against lost wages because of old age and involuntary unemployment. It also created federal funding for state programs providing assistance for low-income aged persons, blind persons, and programs for needy families with children where one parent (usually the father) was unable to support the family. \nThe ADC program provided grants to the states to help finance programs to assist children who were \"deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent\" and who lived with the other parent or a relative. States ran the program and determined eligibility for its benefits. The federal government provided funding for a portion of the expenditures made in state ADC programs. \nThe legislative history of the 1935 act explicitly stated that the purpose of ADC payments was to permit mothers to stay at home rather than work:\nThe very phrases \"mothers' aid\" and \"mothers' pensions\" place an emphasis equivalent to misconstruction of the intention of these laws. These are not primarily aids to mothers but defense measures for children. They are designed to release from the wage-earning role the person whose natural function is to give her children the physical and affectionate guardianship necessary not alone to keep them from falling into social misfortune, but more affirmatively to rear them into citizens capable of contributing to society. \nThe 1935 Social Security Act left administration and many decisions about eligibility to the states. States also determined ADC benefit amounts.\nIn the early years, families receiving ADC benefits were often headed by a widow or had a disabled father. However, over time the natures of both the program and the families it aided changed. The Social Security Amendments of 1939 (P.L. 76-379) added \"survivor\" benefits to the program of old age benefits, renaming it Old Age and Survivors Insurance. Survivor benefits, like old age benefits, were social insurance benefits earned through work in a covered job and paid to spouses and children upon the death of a worker or retiree. This provided an alternative, and more universal, means of aiding widows and their children. The Social Security Amendments of 1956 (P.L. 84-881) added Disability Insurance to Old Age and Survivor Insurance, with the combined program now commonly referred to as Social Security. The 1956 amendments also expanded the types of jobs covered by Social Security. These changes, too, provided more universal means of aiding the types of families that were originally assisted by ADC.\nThe families receiving ADC increasingly were families where the father was alive but absent. The caseload also became increasingly nonwhite.\n\n\t\tThe mid-1950s to the 1960s: Self-Sufficiency and Work\n\nThe issue of whether single mothers should work was also much debated. The intent of ADC to allow single mothers to stay home and raise their children was often met with resistance at the state and local levels. It was also contrary to the reality that low-income women, particularly women of color, were sometimes expected to, and often did, work. Further, the increase in women's labor force participation in the second half of the 20 th century\u2014particularly among married white women\u2014eroded support for payments that permitted single mothers to remain at home and out of the workforce.\nThe Social Security Amendments of 1956 (P.L. 84-881) added the goals of creating \"self-sufficiency\" and strengthening family life to ADC, along with funding for services that would seek to achieve these goals. \nP.L. 87-31, enacted in 1961, first made cash assistance benefits available to families headed by two able-bodied parents at state option. This authority was temporary at first (in response to an economic downturn), but was later made permanent. In 1962, the program was renamed Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The 1962 amendments, the Public Welfare Amendments of 1962 (P.L. 87-543), also established a community work and training program for adult AFDC recipients, largely intended for men in two-parent families.\nThe Social Security Amendments of 1967 (P.L. 90-248) enacted both financial incentives for adult recipients to work and, for the first time, requirements for AFDC mothers to work. These amendments required states to disregard from a family's countable income some earnings when determining its \"need\" and benefits. The amendments also created a new work program under AFDC\u2014the Work Incentive Program (WIN)\u2014that expanded the population served by an AFDC-related work program to women.\n\n\t\tThe Late 1960s and 1970s: Negative Income Tax and Guaranteed Incomes\n\nThe late 1960s marked the beginning of the welfare reform debates, with proposals put to Congress to completely replace AFDC with a different type of program. This occurred as AFDC's costs and the number of families receiving its benefits increased. In 1964, fewer than 1 million families received AFDC. By 1973, the AFDC rolls had increased to 3.1 million families.\nFor the decade beginning in 1969, these proposals were based on the \"negative income tax\" (NIT) concept. The NIT proposals would have provided a guaranteed income to families who had no earnings (the \"income guarantee\" that was part of these proposals). For families with earnings, the NIT would have provided for a gradual reduction in the benefit as earnings increased. \nPresident Nixon proposed to replace AFDC with an NIT-type program in 1969, the Family Assistance Plan (FAP). This proposal also would have nationalized the program, with the federal government paying the income guarantee and states able to supplement the federal guarantee with their own funds. This legislation was not enacted; it passed the House twice but never passed the Senate. In 1972, the Senate Finance Committee proposed to guarantee jobs\u2014rather than income\u2014for parents of school-age children. That proposal, too, did not ultimately pass. \nPresident Carter also proposed an NIT-based cash assistance program coupled with a public service job program in 1977. President Carter's proposals died in committee (they were never reported to either the full House or Senate). A less ambitious proposal from President Carter in 1979 passed the House but did not pass the Senate.\n\n\t\tThe 1980s: Devolution and Early Experiments\n\nThe proposals to change AFDC made by President Reagan at the beginning of his Administration differed sharply from the earlier welfare reform proposals. They emphasized devolution to the states in decisionmaking, rather than nationalization. They also emphasized requirement to work, rather than work incentives. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 ( P.L. 97-35 ) limited the earnings disregard that was enacted in 1967, ending benefits for many who were on the rolls and working. It also gave states expanded authority to require recipients to engage in community service or work experience programs (unpaid work) in exchange for their AFDC benefit. In 1982, President Reagan proposed to completely devolve cash assistance for families with children. That proposal did not pass.\nIn the 1980s, there was increasing attention to \"welfare dependency.\" Research at that time showed that while many mothers were on cash assistance for a short period of time, a substantial minority of mothers remained on the rolls for long periods. Additionally, policymakers began to focus on the possibility that a single mother who left welfare for work might be financially worse off than if she did not work and continued to collect benefits. Such a single mother, who might command relatively low wages in the labor force, risked losing medical assistance from Medicaid for herself and her children and faced work-related costs such as child care. \nThe Family Support Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-485 ) established in AFDC the notion of mutual responsibility between the cash assistance recipient and the state. It created the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) Training program, which provided employment services, education, and training for cash assistance recipients. The Family Support Act also mandated that states provide benefits for two-parent families, though it was on more restrictive terms than those for single-parent families. \nThe Family Support Act also established the Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) program that continued Medicaid coverage for a period of time for those who otherwise would have lost eligibility for Medicaid when moving from welfare to work. Further, it guaranteed child care for AFDC recipients engaged in work activities and provided time-limited (transitional) child care for those who left AFDC for work. Subsequent legislation, enacted in 1990, further expanded child care by creating a new block grant for those without a connection to AFDC, new matching funds to subsidize child care for those \"at risk\" of receiving AFDC, and a major expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\nAdditionally, an era of experimentation on \"welfare-to-work\" initiatives began in the 1980s. President Reagan proposed legislation in 1987 that would have authorized states to conduct demonstration projects that could have included AFDC and any other low-income assistance programs. These demonstrations would have been overseen at the federal level by an Interagency Low-Income Opportunity Board. Though the proposed legislation was not enacted, the Reagan Administration, and subsequently the Administrations of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, issued waivers of AFDC requirements under another provision of law. The experimentation on \"welfare-to-work\" initiatives found that requiring participation in work or job preparation activities could effectively move single mothers off the benefit rolls and into jobs.\n\n\t\t1992 to 1996: \"Ending Welfare As We Know It\"\n\nThe number of families receiving cash assistance had been fairly stable during the period from 1982 to 1988. However, beginning in the summer of 1989 the number of families receiving cash assistance began to increase once again.\n\n\t\t\tPresident Clinton's Proposal\n\nDuring the 1992 presidential campaign, then-candidate Bill Clinton promised to \"end welfare as we know it.\" He stressed time-limited aid and expanded financial supports for those who did go to work. The 1993 tax bill further expanded the EITC. \nPresident Clinton made his welfare reform proposal in June 1994. It would have phased in a two-year limit on AFDC receipt without work, followed by required participation in a wage-paying work program after two years. It would also have expanded funding for training within the first two years. It was estimated to increase child care costs for participants in the JOBS program or the wage-paying work program. The proposal would have barred AFDC to unwed minor mothers.\nPresident Clinton's proposal was never considered by either the House or the Senate. However, during the period before the enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law, the Administration granted waivers of AFDC law to 43 states allowing them to engage in \"welfare reform\" demonstration projects. Some of these waivers were for small-scale demonstrations, but some were for statewide demonstrations of state-designed cash assistance and work programs. \n\n\t\t\tThe Contract with America\n\nWelfare reform was one of 10 legislative initiatives that was included in the \"Contract with America,\" developed by Republicans for the 1994 congressional campaign. The welfare proposal in the Contract with America would have required recipients to work after two years of AFDC (like the Clinton Administration proposal), but it also would have imposed a lifetime five-year limit on benefits. It would have barred AFDC to unwed minor mothers and would have imposed a \"family cap,\" not increasing benefits for new babies born into AFDC families. Funding for AFDC and child care would have been capped, with states given the option to receive AFDC as a block grant. \n\n\t\t\tA Block Grant for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families\n\nH.R. 4 , as introduced at the start of the 104 th Congress, was the Contract with America proposal. However, immediately following the 1994 congressional election, House Republicans worked with several Republican governors to craft an alternative proposal that would block grant funding for AFDC and other social programs. The welfare reform legislation considered by House committees reflected the block grant proposals rather than the original H.R. 4 legislation. Legislation reported from the House committees was bundled into an omnibus welfare reform bill that included the end of AFDC and its replacement with TANF. That bill, the Personal Responsibility Act, substituting for the original text of H.R. 4 , passed the House on March 24, 1995. \nH.R. 4 , as passed by the House, formed the basis for all later welfare reform bills considered and passed by the 104 th Congress. It would have\nreplaced AFDC and related programs of Emergency Assistance, and the work and training program for AFDC recipients, with a block grant to the states for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; allotted TANF basic block grant funds to states based on recent expenditures in AFDC and related programs; allowed states to spend their TANF grants on a broad range of benefits and services; gradually phased in a requirement that 50% of the caseload be either working or engaged in activities, but limited the ability of states to count education and training toward that target; the requirement could also be met, fully or partially, through caseload reduction (i.e., the caseload reduction credit); established a five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance; prohibited unwed minor parents from receiving cash assistance; prohibited states from increasing cash benefits when a new baby was born to a family already on the rolls (the family cap); and limited need-tested benefits for noncitizens in need-tested programs, including requiring that noncitizens be in the United States for five years before being eligible for TANF. \nThe House-passed bill also consolidated AFDC-related child care funding with the block grant created in 1990, and it increased funding for child care. However, it ended the guarantee that those transitioning from welfare-to-work be provided child care.\nThe Senate Finance Committee ordered H.R. 4 reported in May 1995. The Finance Committee bill adopted a similar structure to the House bill. Different from the House bill, however, the Senate Finance Committee bill \nwould have continued a separate employment and training program; did not include a family cap; and did not include the prohibition on benefits to unwed minor parents. \nDisputes about the committee-reported measure over items such as the distribution of funds held up consideration of the bill until August and September of 1995. Negotiations between party leaders in the Senate, Senator Robert Dole for the Republicans and Senator Thomas Daschle for the Democrats, produced an accord that also adopted the basic structure of the House bill but made some substantial modifications. The compromise bill included\na requirement that states continue to spend some of their own funds (a \"maintenance of effort,\" or MOE requirement) in order to receive their full block grant funds; supplemental grants to states with high rates of population growth and/or low historical welfare spending per poor child; a contingency fund for states experiencing economic need; a provision to allow aid to unwed minor parents who were living in an adult supervised setting; and \"charitable choice\" provisions to permit increased participation of faith-based organizations in the delivery of welfare services.\nThe Senate passed its version of H.R. 4 on September 19, 1995.\n\n\t\t\tWelfare Reform Added to the 1995 Budget Bill\u2014First Veto of Welfare Reform\n\nFollowing passage of welfare reform legislation in the Senate, both the House and Senate began the process of crafting legislation to implement the budget adopted for FY1996. On October 17, 1995, the House Budget Committee reported its budget reconciliation bill ( H.R. 2491 ), which included the end of AFDC and its replacement with TANF. It passed the House on October 26, 1995. The Senate version of the budget reconciliation bill also generally included the Senate-passed version of the TANF proposal, and it passed on October 28, 1995. Conferees came to an agreement on the budget reconciliation bill\u2014including the welfare reform provisions\u2014on November 17, 1995. The House- and Senate-approved conference agreement was vetoed by President Clinton on December 6, 1995. President Clinton's veto message highlighted his opposition to cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, the EITC, and child nutrition programs. The President said:\nOn welfare reform, I strongly support real welfare reform that strengthens families and encourages work and responsibility. But the provisions in this bill, when added to the EITC cuts, would cut low-income programs too deeply.\n\n\t\t\tFinal Agreement on H.R. 4 and Second Veto of Welfare Reform\n\nWith the veto of the budget reconciliation bill, attention turned toward finalizing House-Senate agreements on the stand-alone welfare reform bill ( H.R. 4 ). A final conference report on H.R. 4 was filed on December 20, 1995. The final agreement included many of the modifications to TANF that were adopted in the Senate, including\na compromise maintenance of effort requirement; supplemental grants to states with high population growth and/or low historical spending per poor child, but with limited funding; and a state option to impose a family cap.\nPresident Clinton vetoed H.R. 4 on January 9, 1996. In vetoing the bill, the President remarked:\nThe final welfare reform legislation should provide sufficient child care to enable recipients to leave welfare to work; reward States for placing people in jobs; restore the guarantee of health coverage for poor families; require States to maintain their stake in moving people from welfare to work; and protect States and families in the event of economic downturn and population growth.\nThe President also objected to budget cuts not related to the TANF proposal, such as provisions that would have cut spending in food stamps (now the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), benefits for disabled children, benefits for noncitizens, school lunches, and foster care and adoption assistance.\n\n\t\tLegislation Action in 1996\n\nWith welfare reform twice vetoed, the National Governor's Association (NGA) in February 1996 adopted a policy position asking for additional child care funds, additional contingency funds for recessionary periods, and bonus payments for states that meet certain employment outcomes. In May 1996, House and Senate Republicans introduced bills that reflected the policies of the vetoed H.R. 4 and provided additional funding for child care, the TANF contingency fund, and performance bonuses.\nH.R. 3734 , the budget reconciliation bill for that year, included these welfare reform provisions together with a proposal to revise Medicaid. H.R. 3734 passed the House on July 18, 1996. The Senate made a key modification to the bill by dropping its Medicaid provisions. The welfare reform provisions remained in H.R. 3734 , and it passed the Senate on July 23, 1996. A conference agreement on the bill was filed July 30, 1996; it passed the House on July 31, 1996, and the Senate on August 1, 1996. \nPresident Clinton signed the legislation, known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA; P.L. 104-193 ), into law on August 22, 1996.\n\n\tMajor Differences Between AFDC and TANF\n\nThe 1996 welfare reform law repealed AFDC and some of its related programs and replaced it with the TANF block grant. Funding for the AFDC-related child care programs was consolidated into a separate funding stream dedicated to child care. Some things did not change with the 1996 law. As was the case with AFDC, TANF programs are run by states (and sometimes localities), and they determine the maximum benefits under the programs and set the income eligibility thresholds. \n Table 1 summarizes some of the major differences between AFDC and TANF. It should be noted that at the time of enactment of the 1996 law many states were operating under waivers of the AFDC rules that related to cash assistance. These waivers imposed time limits, set different rules for counting earnings than did the AFDC federal rules, and set different rules for work or participation in job activities. TANF permitted states to continue programs operated under waivers, even if the provisions of the waiver were inconsistent with TANF rules. The last of these waivers expired in 2007.\n\n\tOverview of Post-1996 TANF Legislation\n\n\t\tBalanced Budget Act of 1997\n\nThe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA97, P.L. 105-33 ), enacted one year after the 1996 welfare reform law, made a number of changes to TANF. It created a program providing additional funding dedicated to financing work activities. The Welfare-to-Work Grant program (WTW) provided $3 billion for two years, FY1998 and FY1999. Under the program, funding was divided, with 75% provided to states and local workforce areas through a formula and 25% dedicated to competitive grants. The program was originally targeted at the hardest to serve population on TANF and similarly disadvantaged noncustodial parents. The WTW grant program was administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), not the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which administers TANF. Subsequent legislation relaxed requirements for targeting services to the hardest to serve, and as funds were spent more slowly than anticipated, the deadline for expenditures was extended.\nThe BBA97 made several other permanent changes to TANF, including\npermitting a greater percentage of recipients to be counted as engaged in work through education and training, but retaining a limit on counting such participation; setting a statutory limit on transfers from TANF to the Social Services Block Grant at 10%; and making technical corrections to the 1996 welfare reform bill, including technical corrections to TANF.\n\n\t\tAttempts at Reauthorization: 2002-2005\n\nIn February 2002, President George W. Bush made proposals for the reauthorization of the TANF block grant and related welfare reform proposals. The document, Working for Independence, outlined a five-year reauthorization that would have \nfunded the basic TANF block grant at the same level provided from FY1997 through FY2002 for an additional five years; provided mandatory child care funding through FY2007 at its FY2002 level (with no inflation or other adjustment over the period FY2003-FY2007); provided dedicated funding for grants to promote healthy marriage; raised the work participation standard to a minimum of 70% of families with a \"work-eligible individual\" that must be working or engaged in activities; required 40 hours per week of work or engagement in activities for full credit toward meeting the standard, but allowed for partial credit for hours less than 40 hours per week; allowed states to count rehabilitative activities for three months on the rolls, but narrowed the activities that counted after three months to work or community service or work experience; and ended the caseload reduction credit against the work standards, replacing it with a credit for recipients who left the rolls for work.\nThe Bush Administration proposals were incorporated (with some modifications) into bills that passed the House in 2002 and 2003: H.R. 4737 (107 th Congress) and H.R. 4 (108 th Congress). A major difference between the Bush Administration proposal and the House proposals of 2002 and 2003 was that the House proposals retained the caseload reduction credit and provided extra credit to states that had large historical caseload reductions. Following House action, the Senate Finance Committee reported substantially differing versions of each bill. The Senate Finance Committee bills did not narrow the activities that could be counted toward the work participation standard after three months, and they expanded the ability of states to count participation in rehabilitative activities toward the TANF work participation standard. The Senate Finance Committee bills would have replaced the caseload reduction credit with a credit based on employed leavers, families diverted from the rolls, and families receiving work supports. The full Senate never acted on either of the Senate Finance Committee-reported bills.\nIn the absence of reauthorization legislation, TANF program and funding authority was extended on a temporary basis 13 times from 2002 to 2006.\n\n\t\tThe Deficit Reduction Act of 2005\n\nThe early part of 2005 again saw committee action on legislation to reauthorize TANF. On March 9, 2005, the Senate Finance Committee ordered reported legislation that became S. 667 (109 th Congress). The following week, the House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Human Resources considered H.R. 240 and sent it to the full committee. However, further action on TANF reauthorization did not occur until the fall of 2005, when the House and Senate began considering legislation under the budget reconciliation process.\nThe House passed as part of their reconciliation bill (the House amendment to S. 1932 ) the TANF reauthorization bills that essentially incorporated the proposals passed by the House in 2002 and 2003 and were contained in H.R. 240 . The Senate version of the reconciliation bill contained no TANF provisions.\nThe conference report on the budget reconciliation bill included TANF provisions different from those that passed the House. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171 ) included (1) a long-term extension of TANF funding, through the end of FY2010; (2) the elimination of performance bonuses to states; (3) the establishment of a $150 million fund for research and competitive grants on healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood, with $100 million per year for healthy marriage initiatives and $50 million per year for responsible fatherhood initiatives; and (4) changes to TANF work rules, such as counting caseload reduction only from 2005 (rather than 1995) toward the work participation standards, requiring HHS to define specific work activities that may count for each listed statutory work activity, and requiring that states verify work activities of recipients. The DRA also included an increase in mandatory child care funding from $2.717 billion per year to $2.917 billion per year.\nThe conference report on the DRA passed the House on December 19, 2005. Congress finished reconciling differences between the two chambers in February 2006. President Bush signed the DRA into law as P.L. 109-171 on February 8, 2006.\n\n\t\tAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\n\nThe economy entered into a recession after December 2007, with a major financial crisis and accelerating job loss occurring in late 2008. In response, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) passed Congress and was signed by President Obama. ARRA included tax cuts; unemployment insurance provisions; and extra funding for programs, including provisions to provide fiscal relief to states. \nARRA also included $5 billion for a new TANF Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) available to be spent in FY2009 and FY2010. The ECF supplemented funding for the regular TANF contingency fund, which itself was depleted in early FY2010. The ECF reimbursed states for 80% of the cost of increased expenditures for basic assistance, short-term emergency aid, and subsidized employment. ARRA also temporarily froze the TANF caseload reduction credit at prerecession levels, through its application to the FY2011 work participation standards.\n\n\t\tTANF Legislation from 2010 to 2019\n\nThe long-term extension of TANF enacted in the DRA expired at the end of FY2010 (September 30, 2010). Since then, Congress continued TANF program authority and funding through a series of short-term extensions. TANF extensions have been incorporated into stop-gap continuing resolutions or omnibus appropriations bills to fund all or most of the government, added to tax bills, added to unrelated legislation, or passed as stand-alone legislation. (As used in this report, stand-alone legislation represents laws enacted that addressed only TANF and related programs.) There were two gaps in funding for TANF during this period. Funding lapsed during broader \"government shutdowns\" in October 2013 and beginning in December 2018. States were permitted to draw on unspent, previously appropriated TANF funds to finance their TANF activities during the shutdown. \nWhile many of the short-term extensions of TANF funding did not make changes to TANF policy, three extension laws did\nThe Claims Resolution Act of 2010 (CRA, P.L. 111-291 ), a bill to settle claims against the federal government for certain Indian tribes, included a TANF extension through the end of FY2011. It also altered funding for the healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood programs, splitting the combined $150 million appropriation for them at $75 million for healthy marriage and $75 million for responsible fatherhood (it had previously been $100 million for healthy marriage and $50 million for responsible fatherhood). Additionally, the CRA required special one-time reports from the states on how they spend funds and on individuals with no reported hours of work participation. The CRA also provided funding for TANF supplemental grants only through June 30, 2011 (rather than September 30, 2011, the end of the fiscal year). Supplemental grants were not funded for the last quarter of FY2011, nor any fiscal year thereafter. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-96 ) extended TANF through the end of FY2012, and also permanently amended TANF law to require states to act to prevent cash assistance recipients from withdrawing their benefits at Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) at strip clubs, casinos, and liquor stores. The FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 115-31 ) extended funding for the TANF block grant for the remainder of FY2017 and for FY2018. It also financed TANF-related research through a set-aside of 0.33% of the TANF basic block grant appropriation. This reduced the TANF basic block grant to each state by 0.33%. \nIn 2018, the House Ways and Means Committee reported legislation ( H.R. 5861 , 115 th Congress) that would have reauthorized and funded TANF for five years; revised TANF's work rules to measure employment outcomes rather than participation; required all assistance recipients to have an individualized plan; required that all TANF funds be spent on families with incomes at or below 200% of poverty; and required a minimum percentage of TANF funds to be spent on assistance, work activities, or short-term economic aid. The bill was not considered by the full House.\n\n\tDetailed Legislative Chronology\n\n\t\t1996\n\nP.L. 104-193 , enacted August 22, 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, established the block grant of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Funds for most TANF grants were appropriated through FY2002; supplemental grants and the TANF contingency fund were appropriated through FY2001. States were required to implement TANF, and accept their block grant funding, by July 1, 1997, though they could opt to implement earlier. \nP.L. 104-327 , enacted October 19, 1996, amended the transition rule from the pre-TANF programs to TANF that limited total FY1997 federal funding for TANF and pre-TANF programs. It changed the limit on funding to the states for FY1997 from an amount equal to their basic block grant to an amount equal to their basic block grant plus, if they qualified, what they would have received from the TANF contingency fund. \n\n\t\t1997\n\nP.L. 105-33 , enacted August 5, 1997, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, raised the cap limiting the counting of education as work from 20% to 30% of those considered engaged in work, and temporarily removed from that cap teen parents engaged in education through FY1999; set the maximum allowable TANF transfer to Title XX social services at 10% of the block grant (rather than one-third of total transfers); and made technical corrections to P.L. 104-193 . P.L. 105-33 also established the Welfare-to-Work (WTW) grant program within TANF (funded at $3 billion over two years, FY1998 and FY1999), but administered by the Department of Labor at the federal level, with local administration by state workforce investment boards and competitive grantees. \nP.L. 105-89 , enacted November 19, 1997, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, reduced the contingency fund appropriation by $40 million. \n\n\t\t1998\n\nP.L. 105-178 , enacted June 9, 1998, the Transportation Act for the 21 st Century, permitted the use of federal TANF funds as matching funds for reverse commuter grants. It also set the statutory limit on TANF transfers to Title XX social services at 4.25% of the block grant. (Note that subsequent annual appropriation bills restored the 10% limit on TANF transfers to SSBG.) \n\n\t\t1999\n\nP.L. 106-113 , enacted November 29, 1999, an omnibus appropriations act, broadened eligibility for recipients to be served by the WTW grant program and added limited authority for vocational education or job training to be WTW activities. \n\n\t\t2000\n\nP.L. 106-554 , enacted December 21, 2000, an omnibus appropriation act, gave grantees two more years to spend WTW grant funds (for a total of five years from the date of the grant award). \n\n\t\t2002\n\nP.L. 107-147 , enacted March 9, 2002, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act, extended the TANF supplemental grants and contingency funds, both of which had expired on September 30, 2001, through FY2002. Supplemental grants were extended at FY2001 levels. \nP.L. 107-229 , enacted September 30, 2002, a short-term continuing resolution, extended TANF basic grants, supplemental grants, bonus funds, and contingency funds (and other related programs) through December 20, 2002.\nP.L. 107-294 , enacted November 22, 2002, a short-term continuing resolution, extended TANF and related funding through March 30, 2003.\n\n\t\t2003\n\nP.L. 108-7 , enacted February 20, 2003, an omnibus appropriations act, extended TANF and related funding through June 30, 2003.\nP.L. 108-40 , enacted June 30, 2003, a stand-alone bill, extended TANF and related funding through September 30, 2003. \nP.L. 108-89 , enacted October 1, 2003, a multipurpose bill, included an extension of TANF and related funding through March 31, 2004. \n\n\t\t2004\n\nP.L. 108-199 , enacted January 23, 2004, a consolidated appropriations bill, rescinded all remaining unspent WTW formula grant funds, effectively ending the WTW grant program.\nP.L. 108-210 , enacted March 31, 2004, a stand-alone bill, extended TANF and related funding through June 30, 2004.\nP.L. 108-262 , enacted June 30, 2004, a stand-alone bill, extended TANF and related funding through September 30, 2004.\nP.L. 108-308 , enacted September 30, 2004, a stand-alone bill, extended TANF and related funding through March 31, 2005.\n\n\t\t2005\n\nP.L. 109-4 , enacted March 25, 2005, a stand-alone bill, extended TANF and related funding through June 30, 2005.\nP.L. 109-19 , enacted July 1, 2005, a stand-alone bill, extended TANF and related funding through September 30, 2005.\nP.L. 109-68 , enacted September 21, 2005, allowed states to draw upon contingency funds to assist those displaced by Hurricane Katrina, allowing directly affected states to receive funds from the loan fund, with repayment of the loan forgiven, and suspending penalties for failure to meet certain requirements for states directly affected by the hurricane. It also temporarily extended TANF grants through December 30, 2005.\nP.L. 109-161 , enacted December 30, 2005, a stand-alone bill, extended TANF grants through March 30, 2006.\n\n\t\t2006\n\nP.L. 109-171 , enacted February 8, 2006, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, extended most TANF grants through FY2010 (supplemental grants were extended through the end of FY2008), eliminated TANF bonus funds, established competitive grants within TANF for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives, revised the caseload reduction credit, and required HHS to issue regulations to define specific activities that count toward the TANF work participation standards as well as verify work and participation in activities.\n\n\t\t2008\n\nP.L. 110-275 , enacted July 15, 2008, the Medicare Improvements and Patients and Providers Act of 2008, included an extension of TANF supplemental grants through the end of FY2009.\n\n\t\t2009\n\nP.L. 111-5 , enacted February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, established a $5 billion Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) to reimburse states for increased costs associated with the Great Recession for FY2009 and FY2010. The fund reimbursed states, territories, and tribes for 80% of the increased costs of basic assistance, nonrecurrent short-term benefits, and subsidized employment. The law also permitted states to freeze caseload reduction credits at prerecession levels, allowed states to use TANF reserve funds for any benefit or service (it was previously restricted to assistance), and extended supplemental grants through the end of FY2010.\n\n\t\t2010\n\nP.L. 111-242 , enacted September 30, 2010, a short-term continuing resolution, extended TANF funding through December 3, 2010.\nP.L. 111-290 , enacted December 4, 2010, a short-term continuing resolution, extended TANF funding authority through December 18, 2010.\nP.L. 111-291 , enacted December 8, 2010, the Claims Resolution Act of 2010, extended basic TANF funding through the end of FY2011 (September 30, 2011) but provided supplemental grants only through June 30, 2011. It also altered funding for the healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood programs, splitting the combined $150 million appropriation for them at $75 million for healthy marriage and $75 million for responsible fatherhood. The act required some additional reporting on work activities and TANF expenditures.\n\n\t\t2011\n\nP.L. 112-35 , enacted September 30, 2011, the Short-Term TANF Extension Act, extended basic TANF funding for three months, through December 31, 2011. No funding was provided for TANF supplemental grants.\nP.L. 112-78 , enacted December 23, 2011, the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011, extended basic TANF funding for two months, through February 29, 2012.\n\n\t\t2012\n\nP.L. 112-96 , enacted February 22, 2012, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, extended basic TANF funding for the remainder of FY2012 (to September 30, 2012). It also prevented electronic benefit transaction access to TANF cash at liquor stores, casinos, and strip clubs; states would be required to prohibit access to TANF cash at ATMs at such establishments. It also required states to report TANF data in a manner that facilitates the exchange of that data with other programs' data systems.\nP.L. 112-175 , enacted September 28, 2012, a continuing resolution providing funding for the first six months of FY2013, extended TANF funding through March, 2013.\n\n\t\t2013\n\nP.L. 112-275 , enacted January 14, 2013, the Protect Our Kids Act of 2012, appropriated $612 million to the TANF contingency fund for FY2013 and FY2014, and reserved $2 million from each of the two years' appropriations for the activities of a commission to examine child welfare fatalities.\nP.L. 113-6 , enacted March 26, 2013, an omnibus appropriations bill, extended TANF funding through the remainder of FY2013.\nP.L. 113-46 , enacted October 17, 2013, a short-term continuing resolution , extended TANF funding through January 15, 2014.

    "output": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was created in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193). It was born out of the welfare reform debates that spanned four decades, from the 1960s through the 1990s. These debates focused on the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, which provided federal funding for state-run programs delivering assistance to needy families with children, with most families receiving assistance historically being headed by single mothers who were not working. The welfare reform debates focused on whether and how much single mothers should be expected to work, and whether the program itself contributed to dependency by providing disincentives to work and raise children in two-parent families.\nIn 1992, then-candidate Bill Clinton promised to \"end welfare as we know it.\" President Clinton submitted his welfare reform proposal to Congress in June 1994, but Congress did not take any action on it. A welfare reform proposal was included in the House Republican \"Contract with America\" document during the 1994 congressional campaign. This proposal would have altered, but not replaced, AFDC. Immediately after the 1994 congressional campaign, with Republicans taking control of both the House and the Senate, the new House leadership and Republican governors crafted a proposal to end AFDC and replace it with the TANF block grant. This proposal passed Congress as part of two separate pieces of legislation in 1995, but President Clinton vetoed both.\nIn 1996, a revised proposal was offered and passed Congress. On August 22, 1996, President Clinton signed the 1996 welfare reform bill that ended AFDC and replaced it with TANF, a broad-purpose block grant to the states that helps fund a wide range of benefits, services, and activities to address the effects of, and root causes of, child poverty and economic disadvantage. Reflecting its origins in the welfare reform debates, most TANF policy revolves around the state programs of cash assistance and work programs that the block grant helps fund.\nMost TANF policies in effect in 2019 date back to the 1996 welfare reform law. The original funding provided in that law for TANF expired at the end of FY2002 (September 30, 2002), and most of the legislative activity since then has been to continue funding on a short-term basis. From FY2002 to FY2006, TANF was funded by a series of short-term extensions. There was one long-term extension of TANF funding\u2014The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171)\u2014which extended it from FY2006 through the end of FY2010. The DRA also made some changes to TANF work rules and established a program of competitive grants mostly to community-based organizations for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives. Since the end of FY2010, TANF has again been funded by a series of short-term extensions. Most recently, it was extended through June 30, 2019, by the TANF Extension Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-4).",

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nIntroduction\n\nFrom its headwaters in Colorado and Wyoming to its terminus in the Gulf of California, the Colorado River Basin covers more than 246,000 square miles. The river runs through seven U.S. states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California) and Mexico. Pursuant to federal law, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation, part of the Department of the Interior [DOI]) plays a prominent role in the management of the basin's waters. In the Lower Basin (i.e., Arizona, Nevada, and California), Reclamation also serves as water master on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, a role that elevates the status of the federal government in basin water management. The federal role in the management of Colorado River water is magnified by the multiple federally owned and operated water storage and conveyance facilities in the basin, which provide low-cost water and hydropower supplies to water users. \nColorado River water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial (M&I) purposes. The river's flow and stored water also are important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation, among other uses. A majority (70%) of basin water supplies are used to irrigate 5.5 million acres of land; basin waters also provide M&I water supplies to nearly 40 million people. Much of the area that depends on the river for water supplies is outside of the drainage area for the Colorado River Basin. Storage and conveyance facilities on the Colorado River provide trans-basin diversions that serve areas such as Cheyenne, WY; multiple cities in Colorado's Front Range (e.g., Fort Collins, Denver, Boulder, and Colorado Springs, CO); Provo, UT; Albuquerque and Santa Fe, NM; and Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Imperial Valley in Southern California ( Figure 1 ). Colorado River hydropower facilities can provide up to 42 gigawatts of electrical power per year. The river also provides habitat for a wide range of species, including several federally endangered species. It flows through 7 national wildlife refuges and 11 National Park Service (NPS) units; these and other areas of the river support important recreational opportunities.\nPrecipitation and runoff in the basin are highly variable. Water conditions on the river depend largely on snowmelt in the basin's northern areas. Observed data (1906-2018) show that natural flows in the Colorado River Basin in the 20 th century averaged about 14.8 million acre-feet (MAF) annually. Flows have dipped significantly during the current drought, which dates to 2000; natural flows from 2000 to 2018 averaged approximately 12.4 MAF per year . In 2018, Reclamation estimated that the 19-year period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest period in more than 100 years of record keeping. The dry conditions are consistent with prior droughts in the basin that were identified through tree ring studies; some of these droughts lasted for decades. Climate change impacts, including warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, may further increase the likelihood of prolonged drought in the basin.\nPursuant to the multiple compacts, federal laws, court decisions and decrees, contracts, and regulatory guidelines governing Colorado River operations (collectively known as the Law of the River ), Congress and the federal government play a prominent role in the management of the Colorado River. Specifically, Congress funds and oversees Reclamation's management of Colorado River Basin facilities, including facility operations and programs to protect and restore endangered species. Congress has also approved and continues to actively consider Indian water rights settlements involving Colorado River waters, and development of new and expanded water storage in the basin. In addition, Congress has approved funding to mitigate drought and stretch basin water supplies and has considered new authorities for Reclamation to combat drought and enter into agreements with states and Colorado River contractors.\nThis report provides background on management of the Colorado River, including a discussion of trends and agreements since 2000. It also discusses the congressional role in the management of basin waters. \n\n\tThe Law of the River: Foundational Documents and Programs\n\nIn the latter part of the 19 th century, interested parties in the Colorado River Basin began to recognize that local interests alone could not solve the challenges associated with development of the Colorado River. Plans conceived by parties in California's Imperial Valley to divert water from the mainstream of the Colorado River were thwarted because these proposals were subject to the sovereignty of both the United States and Mexico. The river also presented engineering challenges, such as deep canyons and erratic water flows, and economic hurdles that prevented local or state groups from building the necessary storage facilities and canals to provide an adequate water supply. Because local or state groups could not resolve these \"national problems,\" Congress considered ideas to control the Colorado River and resolve potential conflicts between the states. Thus, in an effort to resolve these conflicts and prevent litigation, Congress gave its consent for the states and Reclamation to enter into an agreement to apportion Colorado River water supplies in 1921. \nThe below sections discuss the resulting agreement, the Colorado River Compact, and other documents and agreements that form the basis of the Law of the River, which governs Colorado River operations.\n\n\t\tColorado River Compact\n\nThe Colorado River Compact of 1922, negotiated by the seven basin states and the federal government, was signed by all but one basin state (Arizona). Under the compact, the states established a framework to apportion the water supplies between the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin, with the dividing line between the two basins at Lee Ferry, AZ, near the Utah border. Each basin was apportioned 7.5 MAF annually for beneficial consumptive use, and the Lower Basin was given the right to increase its beneficial consumptive use by an additional 1 MAF annually. The agreement also required Upper Basin states to deliver to the Lower Basin a total of 75 MAF over each 10-year period, thus allowing for averaging over time to make up for low-flow years. The compact did not address inter- or intrastate allocations of water (which it left to future agreements and legislation), nor did it address water to be made available to Mexico, the river's natural terminus; this matter was addressed in subsequent international agreements. The compact was not to become binding until it had been approved by the legislatures of each of the signatory states and by Congress. \n\n\t\tBoulder Canyon Project Act\n\nCongress approved and modified the Colorado River Compact in the Boulder Canyon Project Act (BCPA) of 1928. The act ratified the 1922 compact, authorized the construction of a federal facility to impound water in the Lower Basin (Boulder Dam, later renamed Hoover Dam) and related facilities to deliver water in Southern California (e.g., the All-American Canal, which delivers Colorado River water to California's Imperial Valley), and apportioned the Lower Basin's 7.5 MAF per year among the three Lower Basin states. It provided 4.4 MAF per year to California, 2.8 MAF to Arizona, and 300,000 acre-feet (AF) to Nevada, with the states to divide any surplus waters among them. It also directed the Secretary of the Interior to serve as the sole contracting authority for Colorado River water use in the Lower Basin and authorized several storage projects for study in the Upper Basin. \nCongress's approval of the compact in the BCPA was conditioned on a number of factors, including ratification by California and five other states (thereby allowing the compact to become effective without Arizona's concurrence), and California agreeing by act of its legislature to limit its water use to 4.4 MAF per year and not more than half of any surplus waters. California met this requirement by passing the California Limitation Act of March 4, 1929. \n\n\t\tArizona Ratification and Arizona v. California Decision\n\nArizona did not ratify the Colorado River Compact until 1944, at which time the state began to pursue a federal project to bring Colorado River water to its primary population centers in Phoenix and Tucson. California opposed the project, arguing that under the doctrine of prior appropriation, California's historical use of the river trumped Arizona's rights to the Arizona allotment. California also argued that Colorado River apportionments under the BCPA included water developed on Colorado River tributaries, whereas Arizona claimed, among other things, that these apportionments included the river's mainstream waters only. \nIn 1952, Arizona filed suit in the U.S. Supreme Court to settle the issue. Eleven years later, in the 1963 Arizona v. California decision, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Arizona, finding that Congress had intended to apportion the mainstream of the Colorado River and that California and Arizona each would receive one-half of surplus flows. The same Supreme Court decision held that Section 5 of the BCPA controlled the apportionment of waters among Lower Basin States, and that the BCPA (and not the law of prior appropriation) controlled the apportionment of water among Lower Basin states. The ruling was notable for its directive to forgo traditional Reclamation deference to state law under the Reclamation Act of 1902, and formed the basis for the Secretary of the Interior's unique role as water master for the Lower Basin. The decision also held that Native American reservations on the Colorado River were entitled to priority under the BCPA. Later decrees by the Supreme Court in 1964 and 1979 supplemented the 1963 decision.\nFollowing the Arizona v. California decision, Congress eventually authorized Arizona's conveyance project for Colorado River water, the Central Arizona Project (CAP), in the Colorado River Basin Project Act of 1968 (CRBPA). As a condition for California's support of the project, Arizona agreed that, in the event of shortage conditions, California's 4.4 MAF has priority over CAP water supplies.\n\n\t\t1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty27\n\nIn 1944, the United States signed a water treaty with Mexico (1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty) to guide how the two countries share the waters of the Colorado River and the Rio Grande. The treaty established water allocations for the two countries and created a governance framework (the International Boundary and Water Commission) to resolve disputes arising from the treaty's execution. The treaty requires the United States to provide Mexico with 1.5 MAF of water annually, plus an additional 200,000 AF when a surplus is declared. During drought, the United States may reduce deliveries to Mexico in similar proportion to reductions of U.S. consumptive uses. The treaty has been supplemented by additional agreements between the United States and Mexico, known as m inutes .\n\n\t\tUpper Basin Compact and Colorado River Storage Project Authorizations\n\nProjects originally authorized for study in the Upper Basin under BCPA were not allowed to move forward until the Upper Basin states determined their individual water allocations, which they did under the Upper Colorado River Basin Compact of 1948. The Upper Basin Compact established Colorado (where the largest share of runoff to the river originates) as the largest entitlement holder in the Upper Basin, with rights to 51.75% of any Upper Basin flows after Colorado River Compact obligations to the Lower Basin have been met. Other states also received percentage-based allocations, including Wyoming (14%), New Mexico (11.25%), and Utah (23%). Arizona was allocated 50,000 AF in addition to its Lower Basin apportionment, in recognition of the small portion of the state in the Upper Basin. Basin allocations by state following approval of the Upper Basin Compact (i.e., the allocations that generally guide current water deliveries) are shown below in Figure 2 . The Upper Basin Compact also established the Upper Colorado River Commission, which coordinates operations and positions among Upper Basin states.\nSubsequent federal legislation paved the way for development of Upper Basin allocations. The Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) Act of 1956 authorized storage reservoirs and dams in the Upper Basin, including the Glen Canyon, Flaming Gorge, Navajo, and Curecanti Dams. The act also established the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund, which receives revenues collected in connection with the projects, to be made available for defraying the project's costs of operation, maintenance, and emergency expenditures. \nIn addition to the aforementioned authorization of CAP in Arizona, the 1968 CRBPA amended CRSP to authorize several additional Upper Basin projects (e.g., the Animas La Plata and Central Utah projects) as CRSP participating projects. It also directed that the Secretary of the Interior propose operational criteria for Colorado River Storage Project units (including the releases of water from Lake Powell) that prioritize (1) Treaty Obligations to Mexico, (2) the Colorado River Compact requirement for the Upper Basin to deliver 75 MAF to Lower Basin states over any 10-year period, and (3) carryover storage to meet these needs. The CRBPA also established the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund and the Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund, both of which were authorized to utilize revenues from power generation from relevant Upper and Lower Basin facilities to fund certain expenses in the sub-basins.\n\n\tWater Storage and Operations\n\nDue to the basin's large water storage projects, basin water users are able to store as much as 60 MAF, or about four times the Colorado River's annual flows. Thus, storage and operations in the basin receive considerable attention, particularly at the basin's two largest dams and their storage reservoirs: Glen Canyon Dam/Lake Powell in the Upper Basin (26.2 MAF of storage capacity) and Hoover Dam/Lake Mead in the Lower Basin (26.1 MAF). The status of these projects is of interest to basin stakeholders and observers and is monitored closely by Reclamation. \nGlen Canyon Dam, completed in 1963, provides the linchpin for Upper Basin storage and regulates flows from the Upper Basin to the Lower Basin, pursuant to the Colorado River Compact. It also generates approximately 5 billion kilowatt hours (KWh) of electricity per year, which the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) supplies to 5.8 million customers in Upper Basin States. Other significant storage in the Upper Basin includes the initial \"units\" of the CRSP: the Aspinall Unit in Colorado (including Blue Mesa, Crystal, and Morrow Point dams on the Gunnison River, with combined storage capacity of more than 1 MAF), the Flaming Gorge Unit in Utah (including Flaming Gorge Dam on the Green River, with a capacity of 3.78 MAF), and the Navajo Unit in New Mexico (including Navajo Dam on the San Juan River, with a capacity of 1 MAF). The Upper Basin is also home to 16 \"participating\" projects which are authorized to use water for irrigation, municipal and industrial uses, and other purposes. \nIn the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam, completed in 1936, provides the majority of the Lower Basin's storage and generates about 4.2 billion KWh of electricity per year for customers in California, Arizona, and Nevada. Also important for Lower Basin Operations are Davis Dam/Lake Mohave, which regulates flows to Mexico under the 1944 Treaty, and Parker Dam/Lake Havasu, which impounds water for diversion into the Colorado River Aqueduct (thereby allowing for deliveries to urban areas in southern California) and CAP (allowing for diversion to users in Arizona). Further downstream on the Arizona/California border, Imperial Dam (a diversion dam) diverts Colorado River water to the All-American Canal for use in California's Imperial and Coachella Valleys.\n\n\t\tAnnual Operating Plans\n\nReclamation monitors Colorado River reservoir levels and projects them 24 months into the future in monthly studies (called 24-month studies ). The studies take into account forecasted hydrology, reservoir operations, and diversion and consumptive use schedules to model a single scenario of reservoir conditions. The studies inform operating decisions by Reclamation looking one to two years into the future. They express water storage conditions at Lake Mead and Lake Powell in terms of elevation, as feet above mean sea level (ft).\nIn addition to the 24-month studies, the CRBPA requires the Secretary to transmit to Congress and the governors of the basin states, by January 1 of each year, a report describing the actual operation for the preceding water year and the projected operation for the coming year. This report is commonly referred to as the annual operating plan (AOP). The AOP's projected January 1 water conditions for the upcoming calendar year establish a baseline for future annual operations. \nSince the adoption of guidelines by Reclamation and basin states in 2007 (see below section, \" 2007 Interim Guidelines \"), operations of the Hoover and Glen Canyon Dams have been tied to specific pool elevations at Lake Mead and Lake Powell. For Lake Mead, the first level of shortage (1 st Tier Shortage Condition), under which Arizona and Nevada's allocations would be decreased, would be triggered if Lake Mead falls below 1,075 ft. For Lake Powell, releases under tiered operations are based on storage levels in both Lake Powell and Lake Mead (specific delivery curtailments based on lake levels similar to Lake Mead have not been adopted). \nAs of January 2019, Reclamation predicted that Lake Mead's 2019 elevation would remain above 1,075 ft (approximately 9.6 MAF of storage) and that Lake Powell would remain at its prior year level (i.e., the Upper Elevation Balancing Tier) during 2019. However, Reclamation also projected that there was a 69% chance of a 1 st Tier Shortage Condition at Lake Mead beginning in January 2020. Reclamation predicted a small (3%) chance of Lake Powell dropping to 3,490 feet, or minimum power pool (i.e., a level beyond which hydropower could not be generated) by 2020; the chance of this occurring by 2022 was greater (15%). Improved hydrology for 2019 may decrease the likelihood of shortage in the immediate future.\n\n\tMitigating the Environmental Effects of Colorado River Basin Development\n\nConstruction of most of the Colorado River's water supply infrastructure predated major federal environmental protection statutes, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a74321 et seq. ) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA; 87 Stat. 884, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71531-1544). Thus, many of the environmental impacts associated with the development of basin resources were not originally taken into account. Over time, multiple efforts have been initiated to mitigate these effects. Some of the highest-profile efforts have been associated with water quality (in particular, salinity control) and the effects of facility operations on endangered species. \n\n\t\tSalinity Control\n\nSalinity and water quality are long-standing issues in the Colorado River Basin. Parts of the Upper Basin are covered by salt-bearing shale (which increases salt content in water inflows), and salinity content increases as the river flows downstream due to both natural leaching and return flows from agricultural irrigation. The 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty did not set water quality or salinity standards in the Colorado River Basin. However, after years of dispute between the United States and Mexico regarding the salinity of the water reaching Mexico's border, the two countries reached an agreement on August 30, 1973, with the signing of Minute 242 of the International Boundary and Water Commission. The agreement guarantees Mexico that the average salinity of its treaty deliveries will be no more than 115 parts per million higher than the salt content of the water diverted to the All-American Canal at Imperial Dam in Southern California. To control the salinity of Colorado River water in accordance with this agreement, Congress passed the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-320 ), which authorized desalting and salinity control facilities to improve Colorado River water quality. The most prominent of these facilities is the Yuma Desalting Plant, which was largely completed in 1992 but has never operated at capacity. In 1974, the seven basin states also established water quality standards for salinity through the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum.\n\n\t\tEndangered Species Efforts and Habitat Improvements\n\nCongress enacted the ESA in 1973. As basin species became listed in accordance with the act, federal agencies and nonfederal stakeholders consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to address the conservation of the listed species. As a result of these consultations, several major programs have been developed to protect and restore fish species on the Colorado River and its tributaries. Summaries of some of the key programs are below.\n\n\t\t\tUpper Colorado Endangered Fish Recovery Program\n\nThe Upper Colorado Endangered Fish Recovery Program was established in 1988 to assist in the recovery of four species of endangered fish in the Upper Colorado River Basin. Congress authorized this program in P.L. 106-392 . The program is implemented through several stakeholders under a cooperative agreement signed by the governors of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming; DOI; and the Administrator of WAPA. The recovery goals of the program are to reduce threats to species and improve their status so they are eventually delisted from the ESA. Some of the actions taken in the past include providing adequate instream flows for fish and their habitat, restoring habitat, reducing nonnative fish, augmenting fish populations with stocked fish, and conducting research and monitoring. Reclamation is the lead federal agency for the program and provides the majority of federal funds for implementation. It is also funded through a portion of Upper Basin hydropower revenues from WAPA; FWS; the states of Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah; and water users, among others. \n\n\t\t\tSan Juan River Basin Recovery Implementation Program\n\nThe San Juan River Basin Recovery Implementation Program was established in 1992 to assist in the recovery of ESA-listed fish species on the San Juan River, the Colorado's largest tributary. The program is concerned with the recovery of the Razorback sucker ( Xyrauchen texanus ) and Colorado pikeminnow ( Ptychocheilus Lucius ). Congress authorized this program in P.L. 106-392 with the aim to protect the genetic integrity and population of listed species, conserve and restore habitat (including water quality), reduce nonnative species, and monitor species. The Recovery Program is coordinated by FWS. Reclamation is responsible for operating the Animas-La Plata Project and Navajo Dam on the San Juan River in a way that reduces effects on the fish populations. The program is funded by a portion of revenues from power generation, Reclamation, participating states, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Recovery efforts for listed fish are coordinated with the Upper Colorado River Program discussed above.\n\n\t\t\tGlen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program\n\nThe Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program was established in 1997 in response to a directive from Congress under the Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-575 ) to operate Glen Canyon Dam \"in such a manner as to protect, mitigate adverse impacts to, and improve the values for which Grand Canyon National Park and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area were established.\" This program uses experiments to determine how water flows affect natural resources south of the dam. Reclamation is in charge of modifying flows for experiments, and the U.S. Geological Survey conducts monitoring and other studies to evaluate the effects of the flows. The results are expected to better inform managers how to provide water deliveries and conserve species. The majority of program funding comes from hydropower revenues generated at Glen Canyon Dam.\n\n\t\t\tLower Colorado Multi-Species Conservation Program (MSCP)\n\nThe MSCP is a multistakeholder initiative to conserve 27 species (8 listed under ESA) along the Lower Colorado River while maintaining water and power supplies for farmers, tribes, industries, and urban residents. The MSCP began in 2005 and is planned to last for at least 50 years. The MSCP was created through consultation under ESA. To achieve compliance under ESA, federal entities involved in managing water supplies in the Lower Colorado River met with resource agencies from Arizona, California, and Nevada; Native American Tribes; environmental groups; and recreation interests to develop a program to conserve species along a portion of the Colorado River. A biological opinion (BiOp) issued by the FWS in 1997 served as a basis for the program. Modifications to the 1997 BiOp were made in 2002, and in 2005, the BiOp was renewed for 50 years. Nonfederal entities received an incidental take permit under Section 10(a) of the ESA for their activities in 2005 and shortly thereafter implemented a habitat conservation plan. \nThe objective of the MSCP is to create habitat for listed species, augment the populations of species listed under ESA, maintain current and future water diversions and power production, and abide by the incidental take authorizations for listed species under the ESA. The estimated total cost of the program over its lifetime is approximately $626 million in 2003 dollars ($882 million in 2018 dollars) and is to be split evenly between Reclamation (50%) and the states of California, Nevada, and Arizona (who collectively fund the remaining 50%). The management and implementation of the MSCP is the responsibility of Reclamation, in consultation with a steering committee of stakeholders. \n\n\tTribal Water Rights\n\nTwenty-two federally recognized tribes in the Colorado River Basin have quantified water diversion rights that have been confirmed by court decree or final settlement. These tribes collectively possess rights to 2.9 MAF per year of Colorado River water. However, as of 2015, these tribes typically were using just over half of their quantified rights. Additionally, 13 other basin tribes have reserved water rights claims that have yet to be resolved. Increased water use by tribes with existing water rights, and/or future settlement of claims and additional consumptive use of basin waters by other tribes, is likely to exacerbate the competition for basin water resources. \nThe potential for increased use of tribal water rights (which, once ratified, are counted toward state-specific allocations where the tribal reservation is located) has been studied in recent years. In 2014, Reclamation, working with a group of 10 tribes with significant reserved water rights claims on the Colorado River, initiated a study known as the 10 Tribes Study . The study, published in 2018, estimated that, cumulatively, the 10 tribes could have reserved water rights (including unresolved claims) to divert nearly 2.8 MAF per year. Of these water rights, approximately 2 MAF per year were decreed and an additional 785,273 AF (mostly in the Upper Basin) remained unresolved. The report estimated that, overall, the 10 tribes are diverting (i.e., making use of) almost 1.5 MAF of their 2.8 MAF in resolved and unresolved claims. Table 1 shows these figures at the basin and sub-basin levels. According to the study, the majority of unresolved claims in the Upper Basin are associated with the Ute Tribe in Utah (370,370 AF per year), the Navajo Nation in Utah (314,926 AF), and the Navajo Nation in the Upper Basin in Arizona (77,049 AF).\n\n\tDrought and the Supply/Demand Imbalance in the Colorado River Basin\n\nWhen the Colorado River Compact was originally approved, it was assumed based on the historical record that average annual flows on the river were 16.4 MAF per year. According to Reclamation data, from 1906 to 2018, observed natural flows on the river at Lee Ferry, AZ\u2014the common point of measurement for observed basin flows\u2014averaged 14.8 MAF annually. Natural flows from 2000 to 2018 (i.e., during the ongoing drought) averaged considerably less than that\u201412.4 MAF annually. While natural flows have trended down, consumptive use in the basin has grown and has regularly exceeded natural flows since 2000. From 1971 to 2015, average total consumptive use grew from 13 MAF to over 15 MAF annually. Combined, the two trends have caused a significant drawdown of basin storage levels ( Figure 3 ).\nFrom 2009 to 2015, the largest consumptive water use occurred in the Lower Basin (7.5 MAF per year), while Upper Basin consumptive use averaged about 3.8 MAF annually. Use of Treaty water by Mexico (1.5 MAF per year) and evaporative loss from reservoirs (approximately 2 MAF per year) in both basins also factored significantly into total basin consumptive use. Notably, consumptive use in the Lower Basin, combined with mandatory releases to Mexico, regularly exceeds the mandatory 8.23 MAF per year that must be released from the Upper Basin to the Lower Basin and Mexico pursuant to Reclamation requirements. This imbalance between Lower Basin inflows and use, known as the structural deficit , causes additional stress on basin storage. \nThe current drought in the basin has included some of the lowest flows on record. According to Reclamation, the 19-year period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest period in more than 100 years of record keeping. Observers have pointed out that flows in some recent years have been lower than would be expected given the amount of precipitation that has occurred, and have noted that warmer temperatures appear to be a significant contributor to these diminished flows. Based on these and other observations, some have argued that Colorado River flows are unlikely to return to 20 th century averages, and that future water supply risk is high.\n\n\t\t2012 Reclamation Study\n\nA 2012 study by Reclamation projected a long-term imbalance in supply and demand in the Colorado River Basin. In the study, Reclamation noted that the basin had thus far avoided serious impacts on water supplies due to the significant storage within the system, coupled with the fact that some Upper Basin states have yet to fully develop the use of their allocations. However, Reclamation projected that in the coming half century, flows would decrease by an average of 9% at Lee Ferry and drought would increase in frequency and duration. At the same time, Reclamation projected that demand for basin water supplies would increase, with annual consumptive use projected to rise from 15 MAF to 18.1-20.4 MAF by 2050, depending on population growth. A range of 64%-76% of the growth in demand was expected to come from increased M&I demand. \nReclamation's 2012 study also posited several potential ways to alleviate future shortages in the basin, such as alternative water supplies, demand management, drought action plans, water banking, and water transfer/markets. Some of these options already are being pursued. In particular, some states have become increasingly active in banking unused Colorado River surface water supplies, including through groundwater banks or storage of unused surface waters in Lake Mead (see below section, \" 2007 Interim Guidelines \"). \n\n\tDevelopments and Agreements Since 2000\n\nDrought conditions throughout the basin have raised concerns about potential negative impacts on water supplies. Concerns center on uncertainty that might result if the Secretary of the Interior were to determine that a shortage condition exists in the Lower Basin, and that related curtailments were warranted. Some in Upper Basin States are also concerned about the potential for a c ompact call of Lower Basin states on Upper Basin states. Drought and other uncertainties related to water rights priorities (e.g., potential tribal water rights claims) spurred the development of several efforts that generally attempted to relieve pressure on basin water supplies, stabilize storage levels, and provide assurances of available water supplies. Some of the most prominent developments since the year 2000 (i.e., the beginning of the current drought) are discussed below.\n\n\t\t2003 Quantitative Settlement Agreement\n\nPrior to the 2003 QSA, California had been using approximately 5.2 MAF of Colorado River on average each year (with most of its excess water use attributed to urban areas). Under the QSA, an agreement between several California water districts and DOI, California agreed to reduce its use to the required 4.4 MAF under the Law of the River. It sought to accomplish this aim by quantifying Colorado River entitlement levels of several water contractors; authorizing efforts to conserve additional water supplies (e.g., the lining of the All-American Canal); and providing for several large-scale, long-term agriculture-to-urban water transfers. The QSA also committed the state to a path for restoration and mitigation related to the Salton Sea, a water body in Southern California that was historically sustained by Colorado River irrigation runoff from the Imperial and Coachella Valleys. \nA related agreement between Reclamation and the Lower Basin states, the Inadvertent Overrun and Payback Policy (IOPP), went into effect concurrently with the QSA in 2004. IOPP is an administrative mechanism that provides an accounting of inadvertent overruns in consumptive use compared to the annual entitlements of water users in the Lower Basin. These overruns must be \"paid back\" in the calendar year following the overruns, and the paybacks must be made only from \"extraordinary conservation measures\" above and beyond normal consumptive use.\n\n\t\t2004 Arizona Water Settlements Act\n\nThe 2004 Arizona Water Settlements Act ( P.L. 108-451 , AWSA) significantly altered the allocation of CAP water in Arizona and set the stage for some of the cutbacks in the state that are currently under discussion. It ratified three water rights settlements (one in each title) between the federal government and the State of Arizona, the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC), and the Tohono O'odham Nation, respectively. For the state and its CAP water users, the settlement resolved a final repayment cost for CAP by reducing the water users' reimbursable repayment obligation from about $2.3 billion to $1.65 billion. Additionally, Arizona agreed to new tribal and non-tribal allocations of CAP water so that approximately half of CAP's annual allotment would be available to Indian tribes in Arizona, at a higher priority than most other uses. The tribal communities were authorized to lease the water so long as the water remains within the state via the state's water banking authority. The act also authorized funds to cover the cost of infrastructure required to deliver the water to the Indian communities, much of it derived from power receipts accruing to the Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund. \n\n\t\t2007 Interim Guidelines/Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead\n\nAnother significant development in the basin was the 2007 adoption of the Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead (2007 Interim Guidelines). Development of the agreement began in 2005, when, in response to drought in the Southwest and the decline in basin water storage (and a record low point in Lake Powell of 33% active capacity), the Secretary of the Interior instructed Reclamation to develop coordinated strategies for Colorado River reservoir operations during drought or shortages. The resulting guidelines included criteria for releases from Lakes Mead and Powell determined by \"trigger levels\" in both reservoirs, as well as a schedule of Lower Basin curtailments at different operational tiers ( Table 2 ). Under the guidelines, Arizona and Nevada, which have junior rights to California, would face reduced allocations if Lake Mead elevations dropped below 1,075 ft. At the time, it was thought that the 2007 Guidelines would significantly reduce the risk of Lake Mead falling to 1,025 feet. The guidelines are considered \"interim\" because they were scheduled to expire in 20 years (i.e., at the end of 2026).\nThe 2007 agreement also included for the first time a mechanism by which parties in the Lower Basin were able to store conserved water in Lake Mead, known as Intentionally Created Surplus (ICS). Reclamation accounts for this water annually, and the users storing the water may access the surplus in future years, in accordance with the Law of the River. From 2013 to 2017, the portion of Lake Mead water in storage that was classified as ICS ranged from a low of 711,864 AF in 2015 to a high of 1.261 MAF in 2017 ( Figure 4 ). \n\n\t\tPilot System Conservation Program\n\nIn 2014, Reclamation and several major basin water supply agencies (Central Arizona Water Conservation District, Southern Nevada Water Authority, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, and Denver Water) executed a memorandum of understanding to provide funding for voluntary conservation projects and reductions of water use. These activities had the goal of developing new system water , to be applied toward storage in Lake Mead, by the end of 2019. Congress formally authorized federal participation in these efforts in the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 , Division D ), with an initial sunset date for the authority at the end of FY2018. The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 115-244 , Division A ) extended the authority through the end of FY2022, with the stipulation that Upper Basin agreements could not proceed without the participation of the Upper Basin states through the Upper Colorado River Commission. As of mid-2018, Reclamation estimated that the program had resulted in a total of 194,000 AF of system water conserved. These savings were carried out through 64 projects conserving 47,000 AF in the Upper Basin and 11 projects conserving 147,000 AF in the Lower Basin. \n\n\t\tMinute 319 and Minute 323 Agreements with Mexico87\n\nIn 2017, the United States and Mexico signed Minute 323, which extended and replaced elements of a previous agreement, Minute 319, signed in 2012. Minute 323 included, among other things, options for Mexico to hold water in reserve in U.S. reservoirs for emergencies and water conservation efforts, as well as U.S. commitments for flows to support the ecological health of the Colorado River Delta. It also extended initial Mexican cutback commitments made under Minute 319 (which were similar in structure to the 2007 cutbacks negotiated for Lower Basin states) and established a Binational Water Scarcity Contingency Plan that included additional cutbacks that would be triggered if drought contingency plans (DCPs) are approved by U.S. basin states (see following section, \" 2019 Drought Contingency Plans \").\n\n\t2019 Drought Contingency Plans\n\nOngoing drought conditions and the potential for water supply shortages prompted discussions and negotiations focused on how to conserve additional basin water supplies. After several years of negotiations, on March 19, 2019, Reclamation and the Colorado River Basin states finalized DCPs for both the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin. These plans required final authorization by Congress to be implemented. Following House and Senate hearings on the DCPs in early April, on April 16, 2019, Congress authorized the DCP agreements in the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act ( P.L. 116-14 ). Each of the basin-level DCPs is discussed below in more detail.\n\n\t\tUpper Basin Drought Contingency Plan\n\nThe Upper Basin DCP aims to protect against Lake Powell reaching critically low elevations; it also authorizes storage of conserved water in the Upper Basin that could help establish the foundation for a water use reduction effort (i.e., a \"Demand Management Program\") that may be developed in the future. Under the Upper Basin DCP, the Upper Basin states agree to operate system units to keep the surface of Lake Powell above 3,525 ft, which is 35 ft above the minimum elevation needed to run the dam's hydroelectric plant. Other large Upper Basin reservoirs (e.g., Navajo Reservoir, Blue Mesa Reservoir, and Flaming Gorge Reservoir) would be operated to protect the targeted Lake Powell elevation, potentially through drawdown of their own storage. If established by the states, an Upper Basin DCP Demand Management Program would likely entail willing seller/buyer agreements allowing for temporary paid reductions in water use that would provide for more storage volume in Lake Powell.\nReclamation and other observers have stated their belief that these efforts will significantly decrease the risk of Lake Powell's elevation falling below 3,490 ft, an elevation at which significantly reduced hydropower generation is possible.\n\n\t\tLower Basin Drought Contingency Plan\n\nThe Lower Basin DCP is designed to require Arizona, California, and Nevada to curtail use and thereby contribute additional water to Lake Mead storage at predetermined \"trigger\" elevations, while also creating additional flexibility to incentivize voluntary conservation of water to be stored in Lake Mead, thereby increasing lake levels. Under the DCP, Nevada and Arizona (which were already set to have their supplies curtailed beginning at 1,075 ft under the 2007 Interim Guidelines) are to contribute additional supplies to maintain higher lake levels (i.e., beyond previous commitments). The reductions of supply would reach their maximums when reservoir levels drop below 1,045 ft. At the same time, the Lower Basin DCP would, for the first time, include commitments for delivery cutbacks by California. These cutbacks would begin with 200,000 AF (4.5%) in reductions at Lake Mead elevations of 1,040-1,045 ft, and would increase to as much as 350,000 AF (7.9%) at elevations of 1,025 ft or lower. \nThe curtailments in the Lower Basin DCP are in addition to those agreed to under the 2007 Interim Guidelines and under Minute 323 with Mexico. Specific and cumulative reductions are shown in Table 2 . In addition to the state-level reductions, under the Lower Basin DCP, Reclamation also would agree to pursue efforts to add 100,000 AF or more of system water within the basin. Some of the largest and most controversial reductions under the Lower Basin DCP would occur in Arizona, where pursuant to previous changes under the 2004 AWSA, a large group of agricultural users would face major cutbacks to their CAP water supplies.\nReclamation has noted that the Lower Basin DCP significantly decreases the chance of Lake Mead elevations falling below 1,020 ft, which would be a critically low level. Some parties have pointed out that although the DCP is unlikely to prevent a shortage from being declared at 1,075 ft, it would slow the rate at which the lake recedes thereafter. Combined with the commitments from Mexico, total planned cutbacks under shortage scenarios (i.e., all commitments to date, combined) would reduce Lower Basin consumptive use by 241,000 AF to 1.375 MAF per year, depending on Lake Mead's elevation.\n\n\t\tDrought Contingency Plan Opposition\n\nAlthough the DCPs and the related negotiations were widely praised, some expressed concerns related to the implementation of the DCPs as they relate to federal and state environmental laws. Most Colorado River contractors supported the agreements, but one major basin contractor, Imperial Irrigation District (IID, a major holder of Colorado River water rights in Southern California), did not approve the DCPs. IID has argued that the DCPs will further degrade the Salton Sea, a shrinking and ecologically degraded water body in southern California that relies on drainage flows from lands irrigated using Colorado River water. Following enactment of the DCPs, IID filed suit in state court alleging that state approval of the DCPs violated the California Environmental Quality Act. Others have questioned whether federal implementation of the DCPs without a new or supplemental Environmental Impact Statement might violate federal law, such as NEPA.\n\n\tIssues for Congress\n\n\t\tFunding and Oversight of Existing Facilities and Programs\n\nThe principal role of Congress as it relates to storage facilities on the Colorado River is funding and oversight of facility operations, construction, and programs to protect and restore endangered species (e.g., Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program and the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Program). In the Upper Basin, Colorado River facilities include the 17 active participating units in the Colorado River Storage Projects, as well as the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project. In the Lower Basin, major facilities include the Salt River Project and Theodore Roosevelt Dam, Hoover Dam and All-American Canal, Yuma and Gila Projects, Parker-Davis Project, Central Arizona Project, and Robert B. Griffith Project (now Southern Nevada Water System).\nCongressional appropriations in support of Colorado River projects and programs typically account for a portion of overall project budgets. For example, the Lower Colorado Region's FY2017 operating budget was $517 million; $119.8 million of this total was provided by discretionary appropriations, and the remainder of funding came from power revenues (which are made available without further appropriation) and nonfederal partners. In recent years, Congress has also authorized and appropriated funding that has targeted the Colorado River Basin in general (i.e., the Pilot System Conservation Plan). Congress may choose to extend or amend these and other authorities specific to the basin. \nWhile discretionary appropriations for the Colorado River are of regular interest to Congress, Congress may also be asked to weigh in on Colorado River funding that is not subject to regular appropriations. For instance, in the coming years, the Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund is projected to face a decrease in revenues and may thus have less funding available for congressionally established funding priorities for the Development Fund.\n\n\t\tIndian Water Rights Settlements and Plans for New and Augmented Water Storage\n\nCongress has previously approved Indian water rights settlements associated with more than 2\u00a0MAF of tribal diversion rights on the Colorado River. Only a portion of this water has been developed. Congress likely will face the decision of whether to fund development of previously authorized infrastructure associated with Indian water rights settlements in the Colorado River Basin. For example, the ongoing Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project is being built to serve the Jicarilla Apache Nation, the Navajo Nation, and the City of Gallup, New Mexico. Congress may also be asked to consider new settlements that may result in tribal rights to more Colorado River water. For example, in the 116 th Congress, H.R. 244 would authorize the Navajo Nation Water Settlement in Utah. \nIn addition to development of new tribal water supplies, some states in the Upper Basin have indicated their intent to further develop their Colorado River water entitlements. For example, in the 115 th Congress, Section 4310 of America's Water Infrastructure Act ( P.L. 115-270 ) authorized the Secretary of the Interior to enter into an agreement with the State of Wyoming whereby the state would fund a project to add erosion control to Fontenelle Reservoir in the Upper Basin. The project would allow the state to potentially utilize an additional 80,000 acre-feet of water storage on the Green River, a tributary of the Colorado River. \n\n\t\tDrought Contingency Plan Implementation\n\nCongress may remain interested in implementation of the DCPs, including their success or failure at stemming further Colorado River cutbacks and the extent to which the plans comply with federal environmental laws such as NEPA. Similarly, Congress may be interested in the overall hydrologic status of the Colorado River Basin, as well as future efforts to plan for increased demand in the basin and stretch limited basin water supplies.\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "The Colorado River Basin covers more than 246,000 square miles in seven U.S. states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California) and Mexico. Pursuant to federal law, the Bureau of Reclamation (part of the Department of the Interior) manages much of the basin's water supplies. Colorado River water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial (M&I) uses, but it also is important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreational uses.\nIn recent years, consumptive uses of Colorado River water have exceeded natural flows. This causes an imbalance in the basin's available supplies and competing demands. A drought in the basin dating to 2000 has raised the prospect of water delivery curtailments and decreased hydropower production, among other things. In the future, observers expect that increasing demand for supplies, coupled with the effects of climate change, will further increase the strain on the basin's limited water supplies.\nRiver Management\nThe Law of the River is the commonly used shorthand for the multiple laws, court decisions, and other documents governing Colorado River operations. The foundational document of the Law of the River is the Colorado River Compact of 1922. Pursuant to the compact, the basin states established a framework to apportion the water supplies between the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River, with the dividing line between the two basins at Lee Ferry, AZ (near the Utah border). The Upper and Lower Basins each were allocated 7.5 million acre-feet (MAF) annually under the Colorado River Compact; an additional 1.5 MAF in annual flows was made available to Mexico under a 1944 treaty. Future agreements and court decisions addressed numerous other issues (including intrastate allocations of flows), and subsequent federal legislation provided authority and funding for federal facilities that allowed users to develop their allocations. A Supreme Court ruling also confirmed that Congress designated the Secretary of the Interior as the water master for the Lower Basin, a role in which the federal government manages the delivery of all water below Hoover Dam.\nReclamation and basin stakeholders closely track the status of two large reservoirs\u2014Lake Powell in the Upper Basin and Lake Mead in the Lower Basin\u2014as an indicator of basin storage conditions. Under recent guidelines, dam releases from these facilities are tied to specific water storage levels. For Lake Mead, the first tier of \"shortage,\" under which Arizona's and Nevada's allocations would be decreased, would be triggered if Lake Mead's January 1 elevation is expected to fall below 1,075 feet above mean sea level. As of early 2019, Reclamation projected that there was a 69% chance of a shortage condition at Lake Mead in 2020; there was also a lesser chance of Lake Powell reaching critically low levels. Improved hydrology in early 2019 may decrease the chances of shortage in the immediate future.\nDrought Contingency Plans\nDespite previous efforts to alleviate future shortages, the basin's hydrological outlook has generally worsened in recent years. After several years of negotiations, in early 2019 Reclamation and the basin states transmitted to Congress additional plans to alleviate stress on basin water supplies. These plans, known as the drought contingency plans (DCPs) for the Upper and Lower Basins, were authorized by Congress in April 2019 in the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act (P.L. 116-14). The DCPs among other things obligate Lower Basin states to additional water supply cutbacks at specified storage levels (i.e., cutbacks beyond previous curtailment plans), commit Reclamation to additional water conservation efforts, and coordinate Upper Basin operations to protect Lake Powell storage levels and hydropower generation.\nCongressional Role\nCongress plays a multifaceted role in federal management of the Colorado River basin. Congress funds and oversees management of basin facilities, including operations and programs to protect and restore endangered species. It has also enacted and continues to consider Indian water rights settlements involving Colorado River waters and development of new water storage facilities in the basin. In addition, Congress has approved funding to mitigate water shortages and conserve basin water supplies and has enacted new authorities to combat drought and its effects on basin water users (i.e., the DCPs and other related efforts).",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nIntroduction\n\nA plaintiff injured by a defendant's wrongful conduct may file a tort lawsuit to recover money from that defendant. To name an especially familiar example of a tort, \"a person who causes a crash by negligently driving a vehicle is generally liable to the victim of that crash.\" By forcing people who wrongfully injure others to pay money to their victims, the tort system serves at least two functions: (1) \"deter[ring] people from injuring others\" and (2) \"compensat[ing] those who are injured.\"\nEmployees and officers of the federal government occasionally commit torts just like other members of the general public. Until the mid-20th century, however, the principle of \"sovereign immunity\"\u2014a legal doctrine that bars private citizens from suing a sovereign government without its consent\u2014prohibited plaintiffs from suing the United States for the tortious actions of federal officers and employees. Thus, for a substantial portion of this nation's history, persons injured by torts committed by the federal government's agents were generally unable to obtain financial compensation through the judicial system.\nCongress, deeming this state of affairs unacceptable, ultimately enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) in 1946. The FTCA allows plaintiffs to file and prosecute certain types of tort lawsuits against the United States and thereby potentially recover financial compensation from the federal government. Some FTCA lawsuits are relatively mundane; for instance, a civilian may sue the United States to obtain compensation for injuries sustained as a result of minor accidents on federal property. Other FTCA cases, however, involve grave allegations of government misfeasance. For example, after naval officers allegedly sexually assaulted several women at the infamous Tailhook Convention in 1991, those women invoked the FTCA in an attempt to hold the United States liable for those officers' attacks. Family members of persons killed in the 1993 fire at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco likewise sued the United States under the FTCA, asserting that federal law enforcement agents committed negligent acts that resulted in the deaths of their relatives. Additionally, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed an award of over $100 million against the United States in an FTCA case alleging that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) committed \"egregious government misconduct\" resulting in the wrongful incarceration of several men who were falsely accused of participating in a grisly gangland slaying. \nEmpowering plaintiffs to sue the United States can ensure that persons injured by federal employees receive compensation and justice. However, waiving the government's immunity from tort litigation comes at a significant cost: the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Bureau) reports that the United States spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually to pay tort claims under the FTCA, and the Department of Justice reports that it handles thousands of tort claims filed against the United States each year. Moreover, exposing the United States to tort liability arguably creates a risk that government officials may inappropriately base their decisions \"not on the relevant and applicable policy objectives that should be governing the execution of their authority,\" but rather on a desire to reduce the government's \"possible exposure to substantial civil liability.\"\nAs explained in greater detail below, the FTCA attempts to balance these competing considerations by limiting the circumstances in which a plaintiff may successfully obtain a damages award against the United States. For example, the FTCA categorically bars plaintiffs from pursuing certain types of tort lawsuits against the United States. The FTCA also restricts the types and amount of monetary damages that a plaintiff may recover against the United States. Additionally, the FTCA requires plaintiffs to comply with an array of procedural requirements before filing suit. \nThis report provides an overview of the FTCA. It first discusses the events and policy concerns that led Congress to enact the FTCA, including the background principle of sovereign immunity. The report then explains the effect, scope, and operation of the FTCA's waiver of the United States' immunity from certain types of tort claims. In doing so, the report describes categorical exceptions to the government's waiver of sovereign immunity, statutory limitations on a plaintiff's ability to recover monetary damages under the FTCA, and the procedures that govern tort claims against the United States. The report concludes by discussing various legislative proposals to amend the FTCA.\n\n\tBackground\n\nA person injured by the tortious activity of a federal employee generally has two potential targets that he might name as a defendant in a tort lawsuit: (1) the federal employee who committed the tort and (2) the federal government itself. In many cases, however, suing the employee is not a viable option. For one, as explained in greater detail below, Congress has opted to shield federal officers and employees from personal liability for torts committed within the scope of their employment. Moreover, even if Congress had not decided to insulate federal employees from tort liability, suing an individual is typically an unattractive option for litigants, as individual defendants may lack the financial resources to satisfy an award of monetary damages.\nFor many litigants, the legal and practical unavailability of tort claims against federal employees makes suing the United States a more attractive option. Whereas a private defendant may lack the financial resources to satisfy a judgment rendered against him, the United States possesses sufficient financial resources to pay virtually any judgment that a court might enter against it. \nA plaintiff suing the United States, however, may nonetheless encounter significant obstacles. In accordance with a long-standing legal doctrine known as \"sovereign immunity,\" a private plaintiff ordinarily may not file a lawsuit against a sovereign entity\u2014including the federal government\u2014unless that sovereign consents. For a substantial portion of this nation's history, the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred citizens injured by the torts of a federal officer or employee from initiating or prosecuting a lawsuit against the United States. Until 1946, \"the only practical recourse for citizens injured by the torts of federal employees was to ask Congress to enact private legislation affording them relief\" through \"private bills.\" \nSome, however, criticized the public bill system. Not only did private bills impose \"a substantial burden on the time and attention of Congress,\" some members of the public became increasingly concerned \"that the private bill system was unjust and wrought with political favoritism.\" Thus, in 1946, Congress enacted the FTCA, which effectuated \"a limited waiver of [the federal government's] sovereign immunity\" from certain common law tort claims . With certain exceptions and caveats discussed throughout this report, the FTCA authorizes plaintiffs to bring civil lawsuits\n1. against the United States; 2. for money damages; 3. for injury to or loss of property, or personal injury or death; 4. caused by a federal employee's negligent or wrongful act or omission; 5. while acting within the scope of his office or employment; 6. under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the plaintiff in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\nThus, not only does the FTCA \"free Congress from the burden of passing on petitions for private relief\" by \"transfer[ring] responsibility for deciding disputed tort claims from Congress to the courts,\" it also creates a mechanism to compensate victims of governmental wrongdoing. In addition to this compensatory purpose, the FTCA also aims to \"deter tortious conduct by federal personnel\" by rendering the United States liable for the torts of its agents, thereby incentivizing the government to carefully supervise its employees.\nSignificantly, however, the FTCA does not itself create a new federal cause of action against the United States; rather, the FTCA waives the United States's sovereign immunity from certain types of claims that exist under state tort law . Thus, in most respects, \"the substantive law of the state where the tort occurred determines the liability of the United States\" in an FTCA case. In this way, the FTCA largely \"renders the Government liable in tort as a private individual would be under like circumstances.\" \nCritically, however, \"although the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity is significant and extensive, it is not complete.\" To address \"concerns . . . about the integrity and solvency of the public fisc and the impact that extensive litigation might have on the ability of government officials to focus on and perform their other duties,\" the FTCA affords the United States \"important protections and benefits . . . not enjoyed by other tort defendants\" that are explained extensively below. Moreover, to limit the fora in which a plaintiff may permissibly litigate a tort suit against the United States, Congress vested the federal district courts (as well as a small number of territorial courts) with exclusive jurisdiction over FTCA cases. Furthermore, because Congress believed \"that juries would have difficulty viewing the United States as a defendant without being influenced by the fact that it has a deeper pocket than any other defendant,\" FTCA cases that proceed to trial are generally \"tried by the court without a jury.\" \n\n\tThe Preclusion of Individual Employee Tort Liability Under the FTCA\n\nNotably, the FTCA only authorizes tort lawsuits against the United States itself; it expressly shields individual federal employees from personal liability for torts that they commit within the scope of their employment. In other words, the FTCA \"makes the remedy against the United States under the FTCA exclusive\" of \"any other civil action or proceeding for money damages\" that might otherwise be available \"against the employee whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.\" Congress prohibited courts from holding federal employees personally liable for torts committed within the scope of their employment in order to avert what Congress perceived as \"an immediate crisis involving the prospect of personal liability and the threat of protracted personal tort litigation for the entire Federal workforce.\" Critically, the individual employee generally remains immune from tort liability for torts committed within the scope of his employment even if a provision of the FTCA forecloses the plaintiff from recovering monetary damages from the United States itself.\nAs the following subsections of this report explain, determining whether the FTCA governs a particular tort case\u2014and, thus, whether the FTCA shields the individual who committed the alleged tort from personal liability\u2014requires the court to ask two threshold questions: (1) whether the individual who committed the tort was in fact a federal employee, and, if so, (2) whether that individual committed the tort within the scope of his office or employment.\n\n\t\tEmployees and Independent Contractors\n\nFirst, the FTCA only waives the United States's sovereign immunity as to torts committed by an \" employee of the Government.\" Thus, if a plaintiff attempts to sue the United States for a tort committed by someone who is not a federal employee, the plaintiff's claim against the government will necessarily fail. For the purposes of the FTCA, the term \"employee of the government\" includes\nofficers or employees of any federal agency; members of the military or naval forces of the United States; members of the National Guard while engaged in training or duty under certain provisions of federal law; persons acting on behalf of a federal agency in an official capacity; and officers and employees of a federal public defender organization (except when such employees are performing professional services in the course of providing representation to clients).\nAs a result of this relatively broad definition of \"employee,\" the FTCA effectively waives the government's immunity from torts committed by certain categories of persons who might not ordinarily be considered \"employees\" as a matter of common parlance.\nBecause the FTCA applies only to torts committed by federal employees, the FTCA provision shielding federal employees from personal tort liability does not protect nonemployees. Thus, with certain caveats discussed below, a plaintiff injured by the tortious action of a nonemployee may potentially be able to sue that nonemployee individually under ordinary principles of state tort law, even though he could not sue the United States under the FTCA.\nNotably, the United States commonly hires independent contractors to carry out its governmental objectives. The FTCA, however, explicitly excludes independent contractors from the statutory definition of \"employee.\" As a result, \"the government cannot be held liable\" under the FTCA \"for torts committed by its independent contractors\"; the plaintiff must instead attempt to seek compensation from the contractor itself. \nDifferent courts consider different sets of factors when evaluating whether an alleged tortfeasor is an independent contractor as opposed to a government employee. Most courts, however, hold that \"the critical factor\" when assessing whether a defendant is an employee or an independent contractor for the purposes of the FTCA is whether the federal government possesses the authority \"to control the detailed physical performance of the contractor.\" \"[A] contractor can be said to be an employee or agent of the United States within the intendment of the [FTCA] only where the Government has the power under the contract to supervise a contractor's day-to-day operations and to control the detailed physical performance of the contractor.\" Thus, to illustrate, courts have typically determined that certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) working for federal hospitals qualify as employees under the FTCA. These courts have justified that conclusion on the ground that CRNAs do not ordinarily enjoy broad discretion to exercise their independent judgment when administering anesthesia, but instead operate pursuant to the direct supervision and control of an operating surgeon or anesthesiologist working for the federal government. By contrast, courts have generally held that because physicians who provide medical services at facilities operated by the United States often operate relatively independently of the federal government's control, such physicians ordinarily qualify as \"independent contractors, and not employees of the government for FTCA purposes.\" \n\n\t\t\tThe Boyle Rule\n\nBecause the FTCA's prohibition against suits by individual employees does not insulate independent contractors from liability, a plaintiff injured by the tortious action of an independent contractor working for the federal government may potentially be able to recover compensation directly from that contractor. Nevertheless, a plaintiff asserting a tort claim directly against a federal contractor may still encounter other obstacles to recovery. As the Supreme Court ruled in its 1988 decision in Boyle v. United Technologies Corp. , a plaintiff may not pursue state law tort claims against a government contractor if imposing such liability would either create \"a 'significant conflict'\" with \"an identifiable 'federal policy or interest'\" or \"'frustrate specific objectives' of federal legislation.\" Several courts have therefore rejected tort claims against defense contractors on the ground that allowing such suits to proceed could undesirably interfere with military objectives. Courts have been less willing to extend Boyle immunity to nonmilitary contractors, however.\n\n\t\tScope of Employment\n\nAs noted above, the FTCA applies only to torts that a federal employee commits \"while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\" Thus, \"[i]f a government employee acts outside the scope of his employment when engaging in tortious conduct, an action against the United States under the FTCA will not lie.\" Instead, the plaintiff may potentially \"file a state-law tort action against the\" employee who committed the tort, as the aforementioned protections from liability apply only when employees are acting within the scope of their employment. \nCourts determine whether a federal employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time he committed an alleged tort by applying the law the state in which the tort occurred. Although the legal principles that govern the scope of a tortfeasor's employment vary from state to state, many states consider whether the employer hired the employee to perform the act in question and whether the employee undertook the allegedly tortious activity to promote the employer's interests.\nTwo cases involving vehicular mishaps illustrate how courts perform the scope of employment inquiry in practice. In Barry v. Stevenson , for instance, two soldiers\u2014one driver and one passenger\u2014were returning to their headquarters in a government-owned Humvee military truck after completing a work assignment on a military base. The truck hit a dip in the trail, injuring the passenger. Because the driver \"was engaged in annual Army National Guard training\" and \"driving a government vehicle . . . on government property\" at the time of the accident, the court concluded that the driver \"was acting within the course of his employment\" as a federal officer \"when the injury occurred.\" \nIn Merlonghi v. United States , by contrast, a special agent employed by the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) collided with a motorcyclist while driving home from work in a government vehicle. The agent and the motorcyclist had engaged in a verbal altercation and \"swerved their vehicles back and forth towards each other\" immediately prior to the collision. After brandishing a firearm at the motorcyclist, the agent sharply careened his vehicle into the motorcycle, throwing the motorcyclist to the ground and severely injuring him. The court determined that the agent \"was not acting within the scope of his employment\" at the time of the collision even though \"he was driving a government vehicle and was on call.\" The court first observed that \"engaging in a car chase while driving home from work [wa]s not the type of conduct that OEE hired [the agent] to perform.\" The court also emphasized that the agent \"was not at work, responding to an emergency, or driving to a work assignment\" at the time of the collision. The court further noted that the agent's actions were not \"motivated . . . by a purpose to serve the employer,\" as the agent's \"argument with [the motorcyclist] and the back-and-forth swerving leading to the altercation had nothing to do with an OEE assignment. His conduct related to personal travel and a personal confrontation.\" Because the agent \"was not acting within the scope of his employment when he crashed into\" the motorcyclist, the court ruled that the district court had correctly dismissed the motorcyclist's claims seeking compensation from the United States.\n\n\t\tAttorney General Certification\n\nOccasionally a plaintiff will file a tort suit against an individual without realizing that he is a federal employee. In such cases, the FTCA allows the Attorney General to certify \"that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.\" If the Attorney General files such a certification, then\nthe lawsuit is \"deemed an action against the United States\" under the FTCA; the employee is dismissed from the action, and the United States is substituted as defendant in the employee's place; and the case proceeds against the government in federal court.\nIn such instances, the United States \"remain[s] the federal defendant in the action unless and until the [d]istrict [c]ourt determines that the employee . . . engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment.\" By creating a mechanism by which the United States may substitute itself as the defendant in the individual employee's place, the FTCA effectively \"immunize[s] covered federal employees not simply from liability, but from suit.\" In this way, the FTCA \"relieve[s] covered employees from the cost and effort of defending the lawsuit\" and instead places \"those burdens on the Government's shoulders.\"\nIn some cases, the Attorney General's decision to substitute the United States in the officer's place may adversely affect the plaintiff's chances of prevailing on his claims. Generally speaking, once the Attorney General certifies that the federal employee was acting within the scope of his employment when he committed the allegedly tortious act, \"the FTCA's requirements, exceptions, and defenses apply to the suit.\" Depending on the circumstances, those requirements, exceptions, and defenses can \"absolutely bar [the] plaintiff's case\" against the United States, as explained in greater detail below. Moreover, the individual federal employee remains immune from liability even when the FTCA \"precludes recovery against the Government\" itself. Thus, under certain circumstances, the FTCA will shield both the United States and its employees from liability for its tortious actions, thereby effectively \"leav[ing] certain tort victims without any remedy.\" \n\"In such cases, to try to preserve their lawsuits\" against the federal employee, the plaintiff may attempt to \"contest the Attorney General's scope-of-employment certification.\" That is, the plaintiff may argue that the government employee defendant was not acting within the scope of his employment, such that the suit should therefore proceed against the government official in his personal capacity. If the court agrees that the employee was acting within the scope of employment at the time of the alleged tort, then \"the suit becomes an action against the United States that is governed by the FTCA.\" If, however, the court disagrees with the Attorney General's determination, the suit may proceed against the government employee in his personal capacity.\nA plaintiff may, however, prefer to litigate against the United States rather than against an individual government employee, especially if the employee does not have enough money to satisfy a judgment that the court might ultimately render in the plaintiff's favor. Because government employees may be \"under-insured or judgment proof,\" they may lack sufficient assets to \"satisfy judgments rendered against them\" in tort cases. Thus, oftentimes the plaintiff does not object when the Attorney General certifies that the named defendant was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the alleged tort. \nIf a plaintiff successfully obtains a judgment against the United States based on the tortious conduct of a federal employee, the government may not subsequently sue the culpable employee to recover the amount of money the government paid to the plaintiff. Consequently, if the government successfully substitutes itself for an individual defendant in an FTCA case, that substitution may effectively relieve the individual employee from all civil liability for his allegedly tortious action. Because this aspect of the FTCA is particularly favorable for government employees, if the Attorney General refuses to certify that an employee was acting within the scope of his employment, that employee may at any time before trial petition a federal district court for certification that he was acting within the scope of his employment for the purposes of the FTCA. If the court agrees that the employee was acting within the scope of his employment, then the case proceeds \"against the Government, just as if the Attorney General had filed a certification.\" If, however, the court instead finds that the government employee was not acting within the scope of employment, then the lawsuit may proceed against the government employee in his personal capacity.\n\n\tExceptions to the FTCA's Waiver of Sovereign Immunity\n\nAs mentioned above, the FTCA imposes significant substantive limitations on the types of tort lawsuits a plaintiff may permissibly pursue against the United States. The Congress that enacted the FTCA, concerned about \"unwarranted judicial intrusion[s] into areas of governmental operations and policymaking,\" opted to explicitly preserve the United States' sovereign immunity from more than a dozen categories of claims. Specifically, Section 2680 of the FTCA establishes the following exceptions preventing private litigants from pursuing the following categories of claims against the United States:\n\"Any claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation . . . or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty\"; \"Any claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\"; certain claims arising from the actions of law enforcement officers administering customs and excise laws; certain admiralty claims against the United States for which federal law provides an alternative remedy; claims \"arising out of an act or omission of any employee of the Government in administering\" certain provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917; \"Any claim for damages caused by the imposition or establishment of a quarantine by the United States\"; certain claims predicated upon intentional torts committed by federal employees; \"Any claim for damages caused by the fiscal operations of the Treasury or by the regulation of the monetary system\" ; \"Any claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war\"; \"Any claim arising in a foreign country\"; \"Any claim arising from the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority\"; \"Any claim arising from the activities of the Panama Canal Company\"; or \"Any claim arising from the activities of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or a bank for cooperatives.\"\nSome of these exceptions are more doctrinally significant than others. The following sections of this report therefore discuss the most frequently litigated exceptions to the United States' waiver of immunity from tort claims. \n\n\t\tThe Discretionary Function Exception\n\nFirst, Section 2680(a) \u2014which is \"commonly called the discretionary function exception\" \u2014\"preserves the federal government's immunity . . . when an employee's acts involve the exercise of judgment or choice.\" Along with being one of the most frequently litigated exceptions to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity, the discretionary function exception is, according to at least one commentator, \"the broadest and most consequential.\" For example, the United States has successfully invoked the discretionary function exception to avoid tort liability in cases involving exposures to radiation, asbestos, Agent Orange, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nThe discretionary function exception serves at least two purposes. First, the exception \"prevent[s] judicial 'second-guessing' of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social, economic, and political policy through the medium of an action in tort.\" According to one commentator, the Congress that enacted the FTCA viewed such second guessing to be \"inappropriate\" because (1) \"such judgments are more appropriately left to the political branches of our governmental system;\" and (2) \"courts, which specialize in the resolution of discrete factual and legal disputes,\" may not be \"equipped to make broad policy judgments.\" Second, the discretionary function exception is intended to \"protect the Government from liability that would seriously handicap efficient government operations.\" By insulating the government from liability for the discretionary actions of its employees, the discretionary function exception arguably decreases the likelihood that federal employees will shy away from making sound policy decisions based on a fear of increasing the government's exposure to tort liability. Relatedly, exposing the United States to liability for discretionary acts could cause government officials to \"spend an inordinate amount of their tax-payer compensated time responding to lawsuits\" rather than serving the \"greater good of the community.\" The discretionary function exception thus \"marks the boundary between Congress' willingness to impose tort liability upon the United States and its desire to protect certain governmental activities from exposure to suit by private individuals.\" \nAs explained in greater detail in the following subsections, to determine whether the discretionary function exception bars a particular plaintiff's suit under the FTCA, courts examine whether the federal employee was engaged in conduct that was (1) discretionary and (2) policy-driven. \"If the challenged conduct is both discretionary and policy-driven,\" then the FTCA does not waive the government's sovereign immunity with respect to that conduct, and the plaintiff's FTCA claim must therefore fail. If, by contrast, an official's action either (1) \"does not involve any discretion\" or (2) \"involves discretion,\" but \"does not involve the kind of discretion\u2014consideration of public policy\u2014that the exception was designed to protect,\" then the discretionary function exception does not bar the plaintiff's claim.\n\n\t\t\tWhether the Challenged Conduct Is Discretionary\n\nWhen first evaluating whether \"the conduct that is alleged to have caused the harm\" to the plaintiff \"can fairly be described as discretionary,\" a court must assess \"whether the conduct at issue involves 'an element of judgment or choice' by the employee.\" \"The conduct of federal employees is generally held to be discretionary unless 'a federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.'\" If \"the employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive\" established by a federal statute, regulation, or policy, \"then there is no discretion in the conduct for the discretionary function exception to protect.\" Put another way, the discretionary function exception does not insulate the United States from liability when its employees \"act in violation of a statute or policy that specifically directs them to act otherwise.\" \nEven where a federal statute, regulation, or policy pertaining to the challenged action exists, however, the action may nonetheless qualify as discretionary if the law in question \"predominately uses permissive rather than mandatory language.\" In other words, where \"a government agent's performance of an obligation requires that agent to make judgment calls, the discretionary function exception\" may bar the plaintiff's claim under the FTCA. Notably, \"[t]he presence of a few, isolated provisions cast in mandatory language\" in a federal statute, regulation, or policy \"does not transform an otherwise suggestive set of guidelines into binding\" law that will defeat the discretionary function exception. \"Even when some provisions of a policy are mandatory, governmental action remains discretionary if all of the challenged decisions involved 'an element of judgment or choice.'\"\nThe Fourth Circuit's decision in Rich v. United States exemplifies how courts evaluate whether a federal employee has engaged in discretionary conduct. The plaintiff in Rich \u2014a federal inmate who was stabbed by members of a prison gang\u2014attempted to file an FTCA suit alleging that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) should have housed him separately from the gang members. Federal law permitted\u2014but did not affirmatively require\u2014BOP \"to separate certain inmates from others based on their past behavior.\" Because federal law empowered prison officials to \"consider several factors and exercise independent judgment in determining whether inmates may require separation,\" the Rich court held that BOP's decision whether or not to separate an inmate from others was discretionary in nature and therefore outside the scope of the FTCA.\nBy contrast, in the Supreme Court case of Berkovitz ex rel. Berkovitz v. United States , the discretionary function exception did not shield the United States from liability. The plaintiff in Berkovitz alleged that the federal government issued a license to a vaccine manufacturer \"without first receiving data that the manufacturer must submit showing how the product . . . matched up against regulatory safety standards,\" as required by federal law. After the plaintiff allegedly contracted polio from a vaccine produced by that manufacturer, the plaintiff sued the United States under the FTCA. Because \"a specific statutory and regulatory directive\" divested the United States of any \"discretion to issue a license without first receiving the required test data,\" the Court held that \"the discretionary function exception impose[d] no bar\" to the plaintiff's claim.\nCourts have disagreed regarding whether the discretionary function exception shields tortious conduct that allegedly violates the U.S. Constitution, as contrasted with a federal statute, regulation, or policy. Most courts have held that \"the discretionary-function exception . . . does not shield decisions that exceed constitutional bounds, even if such decisions are imbued with policy considerations.\" These courts reason that \"[t]he government 'has no \"discretion\" to violate the Federal Constitution; its dictates are absolute and imperative.'\" By contrast, a minority of courts have instead concluded that the discretionary function exception shields actions \"based upon [the] exercise of discretion\" even if they are \"constitutionally repugnant.\" These courts base that conclusion on the fact that the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a) purports to shield discretionary judgments even when a government employee abuses his discretion. Still other courts have declined to take a side on this issue.\n\n\t\t\tWhether Policy Considerations Influence the Exercise of the Employee's Discretion\n\nIf the allegedly tortious conduct that injured the plaintiff was discretionary, the court must then evaluate \"whether the exercise or non-exercise of the granted discretion is actually or potentially influenced by policy considerations\" \u2014that is, whether the challenged action \"implicate[s] social, economic, [or] policy judgments.\" As the Supreme Court has recognized, the discretionary function exception \"protects . . . only governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.\" For instance, if a given decision requires a federal employee to \"balance competing interests\" \u2014such as weighing the benefits of a particular public safety measure against that measure's financial costs \u2014then that decision is likely susceptible to policy analysis within the meaning of the discretionary function exception.\nWhen applying the second prong of the discretionary function exception, courts employ an objective rather than a subjective standard. Courts therefore \"do not examine . . . 'whether policy considerations were actually contemplated in making the decision'\" \u2014that is, \"[t]he decision need not actually be grounded in policy considerations so long as it is, by its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\" Indeed, the discretionary function exception \"applies 'even if the discretion has been exercised erroneously' and is deemed to have frustrated the relevant policy purpose.\" For that reason, whether the employee committed negligence in exercising his discretion \"is irrelevant to the applicability of the discretionary function exception.\" Nor does it matter whether the allegedly tortious action was undertaken \"by low-level government officials [or] by high-level policymakers.\" The nature of the conduct challenged by the plaintiff\u2014as opposed to the status of the actor\u2014governs whether the discretionary function exception applies in a given case. As long as the challenged conduct involves the exercise of discretion in furtherance of some policy goal, the discretionary function exception forecloses claims under the FTCA.\nIf the first element of the discretionary function exception is satisfied, then courts will generally presume that the second element is satisfied as well. The Supreme Court has held that when an \"established governmental policy, as expressed or implied by statute, regulation, or agency guidelines, allows a Government agent to exercise discretion, it must be presumed that the agent's acts are grounded in policy when exercising that discretion.\" Nevertheless, a plaintiff may rebut that presumption if \"the challenged actions are not the kind of conduct that can be said to be grounded in the policy of the regulatory regime\" at issue in the case.\nCourts assessing the applicability of the discretionary function exception utilize a \"case-by-case approach. \" Given the fact-intensive nature of the discretionary function inquiry, \"deciding whether a government agent's action is susceptible to policy analysis is often challenging.\" Nevertheless, examples from the case law help illustrate which sorts of governmental actions are susceptible to policy analysis. For instance, in the Rich case discussed above, the court held that \"prisoner placement and the handling of threats posed by inmates against one another are 'part and parcel of the inherently policy-laden endeavor of maintaining order and preserving security within our nation's prisons.'\" The court explained that \"factors such as available resources, proper classification of inmates, and appropriate security levels are 'inherently grounded in social, political, and economic policy.'\" Accordingly, the court held that BOP's decision to house the plaintiff with inmates who ultimately attacked him was susceptible to policy analysis, such that the discretionary function exception shielded the United States from liability.\nBy contrast, courts have held that decisions motivated solely by laziness or careless inattention \"do not reflect the kind of considered judgment 'grounded in social, economic, and political policy'\" that the discretionary function exception is intended to shield from judicial second-guessing. For example, the discretionary function exception does not shield \"[a]n inspector's decision (motivated simply by laziness) to take a smoke break rather than inspect\" a machine that malfunctions and injures the plaintiff, as a mere decision to act carelessly or slothfully \"involves no element of choice or judgment grounded in policy considerations.\" Courts have similarly held that allowing toxic mold to grow on food served at the commissary on a naval base is not a decision influenced by \"social, economic, or political policy,\" and that, as a result, the discretionary function exception does not bar a plaintiff sickened by that mold from suing the United States. \n\n\t\tThe Intentional Tort Exception\n\nAnother important exception to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity is known as the \"intentional tort exception.\" An \"intentional tort,\" as the name suggests, occurs \"when the defendant acted with the intent to injure the plaintiff or with substantial certainty that his action would injure the plaintiff.\" A familiar example of an intentional tort is battery\u2014that is, purposeful harmful or offensive physical contact with another person. Subject to a significant proviso discussed below, the intentional tort exception generally preserves the United States's immunity against claims arising out of\nassault; battery; false imprisonment; false arrest; malicious prosecution; abuse of process; libel; slander; misrepresentation; deceit; or interference with contract rights.\nAs the Supreme Court has observed, however, this list \"does not remove from the FTCA's waiver all intentional torts;\" moreover, the list includes \"certain torts . . . that may arise out of negligent\"\u2014and therefore unintentional\u2014\"conduct.\" Thus, while the phrase \"intentional tort exception\" provides a suitable \"shorthand description\" of the exception's scope, that moniker is, according to the High Court, \"not entirely accurate.\"\nThe FTCA's \"legislative history contains scant commentary\" discussing Congress's rationale for exempting these categories of torts from the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity. However, at least some Members of the Congress that first enacted the FTCA appeared to believe (1) that \"it would be 'unjust' to make the government liable\" for the intentional torts of its employees; and (2) that \"exposing the public fisc to potential liability for assault, battery, and other listed torts would be 'dangerous,' based on the notion that these torts are both easy for plaintiffs to exaggerate and difficult to defend against.\"\nThe intentional tort exception has shielded the United States from liability for serious acts of misconduct allegedly committed by federal officers. In a particularly high-profile example, a group of women who were allegedly sexually assaulted by naval officers at the 1991 Tailhook Convention sued the United States under the FTCA \"for the sexual assaults and batteries allegedly perpetrated by Naval officers at the Convention social events.\" The court ultimately ruled that the intentional tort exception defeated the plaintiffs' claims against the United States, as the alleged sexual assaults constituted intentionally tortious acts.\n\n\t\t\tThe Exception to the Intentional Tort Exception:235 The Law Enforcement Proviso\n\nCritically, however, the intentional tort exception contains a carve-out known as the \"law enforcement proviso\" that renders the United States liable for certain intentional tort claims committed by \"investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government.\" Congress added this proviso \"in 1974 in response to widespread publicity over abuse of powers by federal law enforcement officers.\" Thus, although \"private citizens are barred from bringing suit against federal employees for many intentional torts, they may nonetheless bring suit\" against the United States for a subset of these torts \"if the alleged act was committed by an 'investigative or law enforcement officer.'\" Only the following torts fall within the law enforcement proviso's ambit:\nassault; battery; false imprisonment; false arrest; abuse of process; and malicious prosecution.\nThe list of intentional torts that potentially qualify for the law enforcement proviso therefore contains \"only half\" of \"the torts listed in the intentional tort exception.\" The proviso thereby only \"waives immunity for the types of tort claims typically asserted against criminal law enforcement officers, while preserving immunity for other tort claims that are asserted more broadly against federal employees.\"\nTo determine whether the proviso applies in any given case, the court must first assess whether the alleged tortfeasor qualifies as an \"investigative or law enforcement officer[].\" The FTCA defines that term to include \"any officer of the United States who is empowered by law to\" (1)\u00a0\"execute searches,\" (2) \"seize evidence,\" or (3) \"make arrests for violations of Federal law.\" Some courts have therefore concluded that the law enforcement proviso waives the United States's immunity only against claims for intentional torts committed by \"criminal law enforcement officers,\" as contrasted with \"federal employees who conduct only administrative searches\" like Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screeners. Thus, as a general matter, the United States remains largely immune to claims arising from intentional torts committed by federal employees who are not criminal law enforcement officers.\nIt is important to note that the law enforcement proviso waives the United States's immunity only for acts or omissions committed \"while the officer is 'acting within the scope of his office or employment.'\" The underlying tort need not arise while the officer is executing searches, seizing evidence, or making arrests; so long as the officer is \"act[ing] within the scope of his or her employment\" at the time the tort arises, \"the waiver of sovereign immunity holds.\" In other words, the waiver of sovereign immunity \"effected by the law enforcement proviso extends to acts or omissions of law enforcement officers that arise within the scope of their employment, regardless of whether the officers are engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity\" at the time they commit the allegedly tortious act. To illustrate, the Supreme Court has held that the intentional tort exception will not necessarily bar a federal prisoner's claim \"that correctional officers sexually assaulted . . . him while he was in their custody.\" Assuming that the correctional officers qualified as law enforcement officers within the meaning of the FTCA and were acting within the scope of their employment at the time of the alleged assault, the Court concluded that the law enforcement proviso rendered the intentional tort exception inapplicable even if the correctional officers were not specifically engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity during the assault itself.\n\n\t\tThe Foreign Country Exception\n\nAs the name suggests, the \"foreign country exception\" to the FTCA preserves the United States' sovereign immunity against \"any claim arising in a foreign country.\" The Supreme Court has interpreted this exception to \"bar[] all claims based on any injury suffered in a foreign country, regardless of where the tortious act or omission occurred .\" The exception therefore \"ensure[s] that the United States is not exposed to excessive liability under the laws of a foreign country over which it has no control,\" as could potentially occur if the United States made itself liable to the same extent as any private citizen who commits a tort in that country.\nThe recent case of S.H. ex rel. Holt v. United States illustrates how courts apply the foreign country exception in practice. In that case, a family attempted to sue the United States pursuant to the FTCA, alleging that U.S. Air Force (USAF) officials in California \"negligently approved the family's request for command-sponsored travel to a [USAF] base in Spain\" with substandard medical facilities. When the mother ultimately gave birth prematurely in Spain, her daughter was injured during birth. After the family returned to the United States, American doctors diagnosed the daughter with cerebral palsy resulting from her premature birth. The court concluded that, because the daughter's \"cerebral palsy resulted from the brain injury she sustained in Spain,\" the foreign country exception barred the family's FTCA claim even though doctors did not diagnose the daughter with cerebral palsy until after the family returned the United States. To support its conclusion, the court reasoned that, for the purposes of the foreign country exception, \"an injury is suffered where the harm first 'impinge[s]' upon the body, even if it is later diagnosed elsewhere.\"\n\n\t\tThe Military Exceptions\n\nFinally, two exceptions\u2014one created by Congress, one created by the Supreme Court\u2014preserve the federal government's immunity as to certain torts arising from the United States' military activities.\n\n\t\t\tThe Combatant Activities Exception\n\nThe first such exception, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(j), preserves the United States' immunity from \"[a]ny claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war.\" Although the FTCA's legislative history casts little light on the purpose and intended scope of the combatant activities exception, courts have generally inferred that \"the policy embodied by the combatant activities exception is . . . to preempt state or foreign regulation of federal wartime conduct and to free military commanders from the doubts and uncertainty inherent in potential subjection to civil suit.\"\nThe 1996 case of Clark v. United States illustrates how the combatant activities exception operates in practice. The plaintiff in Clark \u2014a U.S. army sergeant who served in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm\u2014conceived a child with his wife after he returned home to the United States. After the child manifested serious birth defects, the sergeant sued the United States, claiming that his \"exposure to the toxins he encountered while serving in Saudi Arabia\" during Operation Desert Storm \"combined with the medications and shots he received from the U.S. Army\" caused his child to be born with significant injuries. The court concluded that, because a state of war existed during Operation Desert Storm, the sergeant's claims arose \"out of wartime activities by the military\" and were therefore barred by the combatant activities exception.\n\n\t\t\tThe Feres Doctrine\n\nIn addition to the exceptions to liability explicitly enumerated in Section 2680, the Supreme Court has also articulated an additional exception to the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity known as the Feres doctrine. That doctrine derives its name from the 1950 case Feres v. United States , in which several active duty servicemembers (or their executors) attempted to assert a variety of tort claims against the United States. The executor for one of the servicemembers who died in a fire at a military facility, for instance, claimed that the United States had negligently caused the servicemember's death by \"quartering him in barracks known or which should have been known to be unsafe because of a defective heating plant\" and by \"failing to maintain an adequate fire watch.\" The second plaintiff claimed that an Army surgeon negligently left a 30-by-18-inch towel in his stomach during an abdominal operation. The executor of a third servicemember alleged that army surgeons administered \"negligent and unskillful medical treatment\" that resulted in the servicemember's death. The Supreme Court dismissed all three claims, holding \"that the Government is not liable under the [FTCA] for injuries to [military] servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to [military] service.\"\nThe Feres doctrine thus \"applies broadly\" to render the United States immune from tort liability resulting from virtually \"all injuries suffered by military personnel that are even remotely related to the individual's status as a member of the military.\" For instance, courts have frequently barred active duty servicemembers from suing the United States for medical malpractice allegedly committed by military doctors. \nNotably, the Feres doctrine is not explicitly codified in the FTCA . Instead, courts have justified Feres on the ground that subjecting the United States to liability for tort claims arising out of military service could \"disrupt the unique hierarchical and disciplinary structure of the military.\" According to the Supreme Court, \"complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, and . . . control of a military force are essentially professional military judgments.\" In the Supreme Court's view, requiring federal courts to adjudicate \"suits brought by service members against the Government for injuries incurred incident to service\" would thereby embroil \"the judiciary in sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness.\"\nAs discussed in greater detail below, the Feres doctrine has been the subject of significant debate. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed or expanded Feres on several occasions despite opportunities and invitations to overturn or confine its holding. Most recently, on May 20, 2019, the Court denied a petition asking the court to overrule Feres with respect to certain types of medical malpractice claims. Although the Supreme Court has stated that Congress may abrogate or modify Feres by amending the FTCA if it so chooses, Congress has not yet opted to do so.\n\n\tOther Limitations on Damages Under the FTCA\n\nApart from the exceptions to the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity discussed above, the FTCA may also limit a plaintiff's ability to obtain compensation from the federal government in other ways. Although, as a general matter, the damages that a plaintiff may recover in an FTCA suit are typically determined by the law of the state in which the tort occurred, the FTCA imposes several restrictions on the types and amount of damages that a litigant may recover. With few exceptions, plaintiffs may not recover punitive damages or prejudgment interest against the United States. The FTCA likewise bars most awards of attorney's fees against the government. \nFurthermore, with limited exceptions, an FTCA plaintiff may not recover any damages that exceed the amount he initially requested when he submitted his claim to the applicable agency to satisfy the FTCA's exhaustion requirement, which this report discusses below. \"[T]he underlying purpose of\" requiring the plaintiff to specify the maximum amount of damages he seeks \"is to put the government on notice of its maximum potential exposure to liability\" and thereby \"make intelligent settlement decisions.\" Critically, however, a plaintiff can potentially recover damages in excess of the amount he initially requested if the plaintiff can demonstrate \"intervening facts\" or \"newly discovered evidence not reasonably discoverable at the time of presenting the claim to the federal agency\" that warrant a larger award. \n\n\tProcedural Requirements\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned substantive limitations on a plaintiff's ability to pursue a tort lawsuit against the United States, Congress has also established an array of procedural requirements a plaintiff must satisfy in order to validly invoke the FTCA. Most significantly, the FTCA contains statute-of-limitations and exhaustion provisions that limit when a plaintiff may permissibly file a tort lawsuit against the United States.\nFor one, with certain exceptions, a plaintiff may not institute an FTCA action against the United States unless (1) the plaintiff has first \"presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency\" whose employees are responsible for the plaintiff's alleged injury, and (2) that agency has \"finally denied\" the plaintiff's claim. These administrative exhaustion requirements afford federal agencies an opportunity to settle disputes before engaging in formal litigation in the federal courts. \"[E]ncouraging settlement of tort claims within administrative agencies\" in this manner arguably \"reduce[s] court congestion and avoid[s] unnecessary litigation.\" Because litigation can be costly and time-consuming, \"the settlement of claims within administrative agencies\" arguably not only \"benefits FTCA claimants by permitting them to forego the expense of full-blown litigation,\" but also \"frees up limited [governmental] resources for more pressing matters.\"\nA claimant ordinarily has two years from the date of his injury to present a written notification of his FTCA claim \"to the Federal agency whose activities gave rise to the claim.\" This written notification must \"sufficiently describ[e] the injury to enable the agency to begin its own investigation.\" Once the agency receives such notice, it may either settle the claim or deny it. \nWith limited exceptions, if the claimant fails to submit an administrative claim within the two-year time limit, then \"his 'tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred.'\" As a general rule, a plaintiff must \"exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit\"; a plaintiff usually cannot file an FTCA lawsuit and then cure his failure to comply with the exhaustion requirement by belatedly submitting an administrative claim.\nIf, after the claimant submits his claim to the relevant administrative agency, the claimant and the agency agree on a mutually acceptable settlement, no further litigation occurs. Statistics suggest that \"[t]he majority of FTCA . . . claims are resolved on the administrative level and do not go to litigation.\" If the agency does not agree to settle the claim, however, the agency may deny the claim by \"mailing, by certified or registered mail, . . . notice of final denial of the claim\" to the claimant. If no administrative settlement occurs, a claimant's right to a judicial determination \"is preserved and the claimant may file suit in federal court.\" The claimant typically has six months from the date the agency mails its denial to initiate an FTCA lawsuit against the United States in federal court if he so chooses. With limited exceptions, if the plaintiff does not file suit before this six-month deadline, his claim against the United States will be \"forever barred.\"\nIf a federal agency does not promptly decide whether to settle or deny claims that claimants have presented to them, the FTCA establishes a mechanism for constructive exhaustion to prevent claims from being consigned to administrative limbo while the claimant awaits the agency's decision. Pursuant to Section 2675(a) of the FTCA, \"[t]he failure of an agency to make final disposition of a claim within six months after it is filed shall, at the option of the claimant any time thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the claim for purposes of\" the FTCA's exhaustion requirement. Thus, under these limited circumstances, Section 2675(a) authorizes a plaintiff to file an FTCA suit against the United States even before the agency has formally denied his administrative claim.\n\n\tLegislative Proposals to Amend the FTCA\n\nSince Congress first enacted the FTCA in 1946, the federal courts have developed a robust body of judicial precedent interpreting the statute. In recent decades, however, the Supreme Court has rejected several invitations by litigants to modify its long-standing doctrines governing the FTCA's application. In doing so, the Court has expressed reluctance to revisit settled FTCA precedents in the absence of congressional action. Thus, if Congress disapproves of some or all of the legal principles that currently govern FTCA cases, legislative action may be necessary to change the governing standards. \nSome observers have advocated a variety of modifications to the FTCA. Recent legislative proposals to alter the FTCA have included, among other things,\ncarving out certain categories of claims, cases, or plaintiffs to which the FTCA does not apply; expanding or narrowing the FTCA's definition of \"employee\" \u2014which, as discussed above, is presently relatively broad, but does not include independent contractors; and amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680 to create new exceptions to the federal government's waiver of sovereign immunity\u2014or, alternatively, to broaden, narrow, or eliminate existing exceptions.\nProposals to change the FTCA's substantive standards implicate policy questions that Congress may wish to consider. On one hand, broadening the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity could enable a larger number of victims of government wrongdoing to obtain recourse through the federal courts, but could concomitantly increase the total amount of money the United States must pay to tort claimants each year and exacerbate \"concerns . . . about . . . the impact that extensive litigation might have on the ability of government officials to focus on and perform their other duties.\" Conversely, narrowing the FTCA's immunity waiver could result in a larger number of private individuals bearing the costs of government employee misfeasance, but could result in a cost savings to the United States and decrease the potential for judicial interference with federal operations.\n\n\t\tProposals to Abrogate or Modify Feres\n\nOne particular proposal to amend the FTCA that has captured a relatively substantial amount of congressional attention is abrogating or narrowing the Feres doctrine. As discussed above, the Feres doctrine shields the federal government from liability \"for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to [military] service.\" Opponents of Feres argue that the doctrine inappropriately bars servicemembers from obtaining recourse for their injuries. Critics maintain that Feres 's bar on FTCA suits creates especially unjust results with respect to servicemembers who suffer injuries in military hospitals and servicemembers who are victims of sexual abuse, as those types of tortious actions are far removed from the core functions of the military. Some Members of Congress, judges, and legal commentators have therefore advocated eliminating or narrowing the Feres doctrine to allow servicemembers to pursue certain tort claims against the United States under the FTCA.\nSupporters of Feres , by contrast, have instead urged Congress to retain the Feres doctrine in its current form. These commentators contend \"that the abolition of the Feres doctrine would lead to intra-military lawsuits that would have a very adverse effect on military order, discipline and effectiveness.\" Supporters further maintain that entertaining tort suits by servicemembers against the United States would increase the government's exposure to monetary liability. Some who support the Feres doctrine argue that even though Feres bars servicemembers from suing the United States under the FTCA for injuries they sustain incident to military service, Feres does not necessarily leave servicemembers without any remedy whatsoever; depending on the circumstances, injured servicemembers may be entitled to certain benefits under other federal statutes.\nCongress has periodically held hearings to assess whether to retain, abrogate, or modify the Feres doctrine. The House Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Military Personnel conducted the most recent of those hearings on April 30, 2019.\nIf Congress desires to authorize servicemembers to prosecute tort lawsuits against the United States, it has several options. For example, Congress could abolish Feres in its entirety and allow servicemembers to file tort suits against the United States subject to the same exceptions and prerequisites that govern FTCA lawsuits initiated by nonservicemembers. Alternatively, instead of abrogating Feres entirely, Congress could allow servicemembers to sue the United States for only certain injuries arising from military service, such as injuries resulting from medical malpractice. As an alternative to authorizing full-fledged litigation against the United States in federal court, Congress could also create alternative compensation mechanisms intended to provide relief to injured servicemembers whose claims would otherwise be barred by Feres . Such alternative compensation procedures could, for example, resemble the alternative compensation scheme Congress established for persons injured by vaccines.\nTo that end, Congress has periodically introduced bills proposing to modify the Feres doctrine. Most recently, several Members of the 116th Congress cosponsored the Sfc. Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act of 2019 ( H.R. 2422 ), which would authorize \"member[s] of the Armed Forces of the United States\" to bring claims \"against the United States under [the FTCA] for damages . . . arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance of medical, dental, or related health care functions\" rendered at certain military medical treatment facilities under specified conditions.\n\n\t\tPrivate Bills\n\nIn addition to proposals to modify the FTCA itself, Congress retains the authority to enact private legislation to compensate individual tort victims who would otherwise be barred from obtaining recourse from the United States under the FTCA in its current form. Although, as explained above, Congress enacted the FTCA in part to eliminate the need to pass private bills in order to compensate persons injured by the federal government, Congress still retains some authority to pass private bills if it so desires. Thus, rather than amend the FTCA to expand the universe of circumstances in which the United States will be liable to tort claimants, some have suggested that Congress should pass individual private bills to compensate particular injured persons or groups of persons who might otherwise lack recourse under the FTCA. To that end, Congress has occasionally \"provided compensation [to plaintiffs] in situations where the courts have found that the FTCA waiver of immunity provides no relief.\"\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "A plaintiff injured by a defendant's wrongful act may file a tort lawsuit to recover money from that defendant. To name a particularly familiar example, a person who negligently causes a vehicular collision may be liable to the victim of that crash. By forcing people who wrongfully injure others to pay money to their victims, the tort system serves at least two functions: (1) deterring people from injuring others and (2) compensating those who are injured.\nEmployees and officers of the federal government occasionally commit torts just like other members of the general public. For a substantial portion of this nation's history, however, plaintiffs injured by the tortious acts of a federal officer or employee were barred from filing lawsuits against the United States by \"sovereign immunity\"\u2014a legal doctrine that ordinarily prohibits private citizens from haling a sovereign state into court without its consent. Until the mid-20th century, a tort victim could obtain compensation from the United States only by persuading Congress to pass a private bill compensating him for his loss.\nCongress, deeming this state of affairs unacceptable, enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which authorizes plaintiffs to obtain compensation from the United States for the torts of its employees. However, subjecting the federal government to tort liability not only creates a financial cost to the United States, it also creates a risk that government officials may inappropriately base their decisions not on socially desirable policy objectives, but rather on the desire to reduce the government's exposure to monetary damages. In an attempt to mitigate these potential negative effects of abrogating the government's immunity from liability and litigation, the FTCA limits the circumstances in which a plaintiff may pursue a tort lawsuit against the United States. For example, the FTCA contains several exceptions that categorically bar plaintiffs from recovering tort damages in certain categories of cases. Federal law also restricts the types and amount of damages a victorious plaintiff may recover in an FTCA suit. Additionally, a plaintiff may not initiate an FTCA lawsuit unless he has timely complied with a series of procedural requirements, such as providing the government an initial opportunity to evaluate the plaintiff's claim and decide whether to settle it before the case proceeds to federal court.\nSince Congress first enacted the FTCA, the federal courts have developed a robust body of judicial precedent interpreting the statute's contours. In recent years, however, the Supreme Court has expressed reluctance to reconsider its long-standing FTCA precedents, thereby leaving the task of further developing the FTCA to Congress. Some Members of Congress have accordingly proposed legislation to modify the FTCA in various respects, such as by broadening the circumstances in which a plaintiff may hold the United States liable for torts committed by government employees.",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nT his report describes actions taken by the Administration and Congress to provide FY2019 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) accounts. It also provides an overview of enacted FY2018 appropriations for agencies and bureaus funded as part of annual CJS appropriations. The second part of this report provides an overview of historical funding trends for CJS.\nThe dollar amounts in this report reflect only new funding made available at the start of the fiscal year. Therefore, the amounts do not include any rescissions of unobligated or deobligated balances that may be counted as offsets to newly enacted appropriations, nor do they include any scorekeeping adjustments (e.g., the budgetary effects of provisions limiting the availability of the balance in the Crime Victims Fund). In the text of the report, appropriations are rounded to the nearest million. However, percentage changes are calculated using whole, not rounded, numbers, meaning that in some instances there may be small differences between the actual percentage change and the percentage change that would be calculated by using the rounded amounts presented in the report.\n\n\tOverview of CJS\n\nThe annual CJS appropriations act provides funding for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, select science agencies, and several related agencies. Appropriations for the Department of Commerce include funding for agencies such as the Census Bureau; the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Appropriations for the Department of Justice (DOJ) provide funding for agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Bureau of Prisons; the U.S. Marshals Service; the Drug Enforcement Administration; and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, along with funding for a variety of grant programs for state, local, and tribal governments.

The OSTP director also manages the National Science and Technology Council, which coordinates science and technology policy across the executive branch of the federal government, and cochairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, a council of external advisors that provides advice to the President on matters related to science and technology policy.\n\n\t\t\tThe National Space Council\n\nThe National Space Council, in the Executive Office of the President, is a coordinating body for U.S. space policy. Chaired by the Vice President, it consists of the Secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce, Transportation, and Homeland Security; the Administrator of NASA; and other senior officials. The council previously existed from 1988 to 1993 and was reestablished by the Trump Administration in June 2017.\n\n\t\t\tNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities. It has four mission directorates. The Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate is responsible for human spaceflight activities, including the International Space Station and development efforts for future crewed spacecraft. The Science Mission Directorate manages robotic science missions, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Mars rover Curiosity, and satellites for Earth science research. The Space Technology Mission Directorate develops new technologies for use in future space missions, such as advanced propulsion and laser communications. The Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate conducts research and development on aircraft and aviation systems. In addition, NASA's Office of STEM Engagement (formerly the Office of Education) manages education programs for schoolchildren, college and university students, and the general public.\n\n\t\t\tNational Science Foundation\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in the nonmedical sciences and engineering. The foundation was established as an independent federal agency \"to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.\" The NSF is a primary source of federal support for U.S. university research. It is also responsible for significant shares of the federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education program portfolio and federal STEM student aid and support.\n\n\t\tRelated Agencies\n\nThe annual CJS appropriations act includes funding for several related agencies: \nU.S. Commission on Civil Rights informs the development of national civil rights policy and enhances enforcement of federal civil rights laws; Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information; International Trade Commission investigates the effects of dumped and subsidized imports on domestic industries and conducts global safeguard investigations, adjudicates cases involving imports that allegedly infringe intellectual property rights, and serves as a resource for trade data and other trade policy-related information; Legal Services Corporation is a federally funded nonprofit corporation that provides financial support for civil legal aid to low-income Americans; Marine Mammal Commission works for the conservation of marine mammals by providing science-based oversight of domestic and international policies and actions of federal agencies with a mandate to address human effects on marine mammals and their ecosystems; Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade, commodity, and direct investment policy, and overseeing negotiations with other countries; and State Justice Institute is a federally funded nonprofit corporation that awards grants to improve the quality of justice in state courts and foster innovative, efficient solutions to common issues faced by all courts.\n\n\tFY2018 Enacted Funding\n\nFor FY2018, Congress and the President provided a total of $72.119 billion for CJS. This included $70.921 billion in regular funding provided pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 , see Table 1 ) and $1.198 billion in emergency-designated funding provided pursuant to the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-123 , see Table 2 ). For FY2018, the Department of Commerce received $12.137 billion ($11.137 billion in regular funding and $1.000 billion in supplemental funding), the Department of Justice received $30.384 billion ($30.299 billion in regular funding and $85 million in supplemental funding), the science agencies received $28.609 billion ($28.511 billion in regular funding and $98 million in supplemental funding), and the related agencies received $989 million ($974 million in regular funding and $15 million in supplemental funding).\nComparisons in this report between FY2018 enacted funding and the Administration's FY2019 request, the House and Senate committee-reported FY2019 amounts, and FY2019 enacted funding are based on FY2018 regular funding (i.e., FY2018 enacted funding excluding supplemental appropriations). \n\n\tThe Administration's FY2019 Budget Request\n\nThe Administration requested $66.555 billion for CJS for FY2019, which was 6.2% less than FY2018 regular funding. When comparing the Administration's FY2019 request to the FY2018 funding, it should be considered that the Administration formulated its FY2019 budget request before full-year appropriations for FY2018 were enacted. FY2018 funding levels, for the purposes of the Administration's request, were calculated based on FY2017 funding minus a reduction (0.6791%) as extended under a series of continuing resolutions.\nThe Administration requested the following: \n$9.797 billion for the Department of Commerce, which was 12.0% less than FY2018 regular funding; $28.835 billion for the Department of Justice, which was 4.8% less than FY2018 regular funding; $27.372 billion for the science agencies, which was 4.0% less than FY2018 regular funding; and $551 million for the related agencies, which was 43.4% less than FY2018 regular funding.\nThe Administration's FY2019 budget for CJS proposed eliminating several agencies and programs:\nEDA, NIST's Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the Community Relations Service (its functions would have been moved to DOJ's Civil Rights Division), COPS Office (grants managed by the COPS Office would have been moved to OJP), NASA's Education program, and the Legal Services Corporation.\nThe Administration requested some funding for the EDA and Legal Services Corporation for what would have been an orderly closeout of these agencies had Congress adopted the Administration's proposal. \nThe Administration's budget also proposed to move funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program to the DEA. Currently, HIDTA funding is administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\nThe Administration's requested funding for many CJS accounts was below FY2018 levels; however, there were a handful of exceptions:\nthe Census Bureau's Periodic Census and Programs account (+$1.007 billion, +39.6%), DOJ's Executive Office of Immigration Review (+$59 million, +11.8%), ATF (+$23 million, +1.8%), BIS (+$7 million, +6.3%), NSF's Agency Operations and Award Management account (+$5 million, +1.6%), ESA (+$2 million, +2.0%), and the State Justice Institute (+$2 million, +35.1%).\nThe Administration also proposed a new account structure for NASA, with three new accounts: Exploration Research and Technology, Deep Space Exploration Systems, and low Earth orbit (LEO) and Spaceflight Operations. The proposed Exploration Research and Technology account would have combined the Space Technology account with some elements of the Exploration account and the proposed Deep Space Exploration Systems account would have been the Exploration account minus the elements moved to the Exploration Research and Technology account. LEO and Spaceflight Operations would essentially have been a renaming of the Space Operations account. \n\n\tThe House Committee-Reported Bill (H.R. 5952)\n\nThe House committee-reported bill ( H.R. 5952 ) would have provided a total of $73.923 billion for CJS for FY2019, an amount that was 4.2% greater than regular FY2018 funding and 11.1% greater than the Administration's request. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended the following:\n$12.106 billion for the Department of Commerce, which was 8.7% greater than regular FY2018 funding and 23.6% greater than the Administration's request; $31.113 billion for the Department of Justice, which was 2.7% greater than regular FY2018 funding and 7.9% greater than the Administration's request; $29.728 billion for the science agencies, which was 4.3% greater than regular FY2018 funding and 8.6% greater than the Administration's request; and $976 million for the related agencies, which was 0.2% greater than regular FY2018 funding and 77.1% greater than the Administration's request.\nThe committee-reported bill would have increased funding for most CJS accounts compared to regular FY2018 funding. Some of the exceptions included the following:\nITA (-$2 million, -0.4%); NIST's Scientific and Technical Research and Services account (-$5\u00a0million, -0.6%); NIST's Industrial Technology Services account (-$10 million, -6.5%); NIST's Construction of Research Facilities account (-$199 million, -62.4%); NOAA's Operations, Research, and Facilities account (-$63 million, -1.8%); NOAA's Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction account (-$683\u00a0million, -29.8%); U.S. Marshals' Construction account (-$28 million, -53.2%); FBI's Construction account (-$305 million, -82.4%); BOP's Buildings and Facilities account (-$12 million, -7.2%); Juvenile Justice Programs (-$71 million, -25.0%); and NASA's Education account (-$10 million, -10.0%).\nIn general, the committee-reported bill would have funded CJS accounts at or above the Administration's request, but there were a few exceptions:\nBIS (-$7 million, -5.9%); NOAA's Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction account (-$15\u00a0million, -0.9%); DOJ's General Administration Salaries and Expenses (-$12 million, -10.3%); Juvenile Justice Programs (-$18 million, -7.6%); NASA's Operations Research and Technology account (-$103 million, -10.2%); and the State Justice Institute (-$1 million, -15.9%).\nThe House Committee on Appropriations did not adopt most of the Administration's proposals. The committee did not eliminate funding for EDA, NIST's Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the Community Relations Service, NASA's Education program, and the Legal Services Corporation. With the exception of NASA's Education program, the committee-reported bill would have funded these agencies and programs at a level equal to FY2018 regular funding. Additionally, the committee-reported bill did not provide funding for the HIDTA program under the DEA. However, the committee adopted two of the Administration's proposals. Funding for the COPS program would have been moved to OJP under H.R. 5952 . Also, the committee-reported bill included the Administration's proposed account structure for NASA.\n\n\tThe Senate Committee-Reported Bill (S. 3072)\n\nThe Senate committee-reported bill ( S. 3072 ) would have provided a total of $72.648 billion for CJS for FY2019, an amount that was 2.4% more than regular FY2018 funding and 9.2% more than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill would have provided the following:\n$11.572 billion for the Department of Commerce, which was 3.9% more than regular FY2018 funding and 18.1% more than the Administration's request; $30.699 billion for the Department of Justice, which was 1.3% more than regular FY2018 funding and 6.5% more than the Administration's request; $29.400 billion for the science agencies, which was 3.1% more than regular FY2018 funding and 7.4% more than the Administration's request; and $977 million for the related agencies, which was 0.4% more than regular FY2018 funding and 77.3% more than the Administration's request.\nIn general, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding many CJS accounts at or above the regular FY2018 funding amount. A few notable exceptions included the following:\nNIST's Construction of Research Facilities account (-$161 million, -50.5%); NOAA's Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction account (-$484\u00a0million, -21.1%); U.S. Marshals' Construction account (-$18 million, -34.5%); DOJ's Interagency Law Enforcement account (-$21 million, -3.9%); NASA's Space Operations account (-$112 million, -2.4%); NASA's Safety, Security, and Mission Services account (-$77 million, -2.7%); and NASA's Construction and Environmental Compliance and Restoration account (-$174 million, -31.0%).\nThe Senate committee-reported bill would have funded nearly every CJS account at or above the level requested by the Administration. The Senate Committee on Appropriations also declined to adopt many of the proposals the Administration put forth in its FY2019 budget. Unlike the House committee-reported bill, S. 3072 would have funded the COPS program through its own account and the committee did not include the Administration's new account structure for NASA. The committee did propose changing the name of NASA's Education account to \"Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Opportunities.\" The Senate bill would have also funded the Office on Violence Against Women via a transfer from the Crime Victims Fund.\n\n\tFY2019 Enacted Funding\n\nOn February 15, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), which includes $72.908 billion for CJS. The FY2019 enacted amount is 2.8% more than regular FY2018 funding and 9.5% more than the Administration's request. The act includes the following:\n$11.414 billion for the Department of Commerce, which is 2.5% more than regular FY2018 funding and 16.5% more than the Administration's request; $30.934 billion for the Department of Justice, which is 2.1% more than regular FY2018 funding and 7.3% more than the Administration's request; $29.583 billion for the science agencies, which is 3.8% more than regular FY2018 funding and 8.1% more than the Administration's request; and $977 million for the related agencies, which is 0.3% more than regular FY2018 funding and 77.3% more than the Administration's request.\nFY2019 enacted funding is generally in-line with regular FY2018 funding and higher than the Administration's request. Some notable increases in FY2019 enacted funding compared to regular FY2018 funding include the following:\nCensus Bureau's Periodic Censuses and Programs account (+$1.007 billion, +39.6%), Executive Office of Immigration Review (+$59 million, +11.8%), U.S. Attorneys (+$75 million, +3.5%), U.S. Marshals' Salaries and Expenses account (+$47 million, +3.5%), FBI's Salaries and Expenses account (+$162 million, +1.8%), DEA's Salaries and Expenses account (+$77 million, +3.5%), BOP's Salaries and Expenses account (+$136 million, +1.9%), BOP's Buildings and Facilities account (+$102 million, 63.4%), NASA's Science account (+$684 million, +11.0%), NASA's Space Technology account (+$167 million, +22.0%), NASA's Exploration account (+$261 million, +5.4%), NSF's Research and Related Activities account (+$186 million, +2.9%), and NSF's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction account (+$113 million, +61.8%).\nThere were also a few notable decreases in FY2019 enacted funding compared to regular FY2018 funding:\nNIST's Construction of Research Facilities account (-$213 million, -66.8%); NOAA's Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction account (-$535 million, -23.4%); U.S. Marshals' Construction account (-$38 million, -71.9%); NASA's Space Operations account (-$112 million, -2.4%); and NASA's Construction and Environmental Compliance and Restoration account (-$214 million, -38.1%).\nCongress largely declined to adopt the Administration's proposals for CJS. Congress did not adopt the Administration's proposed account structure for NASA (though Congress changed the name of NASA's Education account to the \"Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Engagement\" account), it did not move funding for the HIDTA program to the DEA, and it did not move COPS funding to OJP. Congress also provided funding for the EDA, NIST's Manufacturing Extension Partnership, DOJ's Community Relations Service, and the Legal Services Corporation, all of which the Administration proposed eliminating.\n Table 1 outlines the FY2018 funding, the Administration's FY2019 request, the House and the Senate committee-reported amounts, and FY2019 funding for the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the science agencies, and the related agencies. Table 2 provides information on FY2018 supplemental funding for CJS.\n\n\tHistorical Funding for CJS\n\n Figure 1 shows the total CJS funding for FY2009-FY2018, in both nominal and inflation-adjusted dollars (more-detailed historical appropriations data can be found in Table 3 ). The data show that nominal funding for CJS reached a new 10-year high in FY2018, if emergency supplemental funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) is not counted. Otherwise, peak funding for CJS over the past 10 fiscal years was in FY2009 when ARRA provided a substantial increase in funding. The $15.992 billion in funding for CJS under ARRA added approximately 25% to the amount Congress and the President provided for CJS through the regular appropriation process that year. While regular nominal funding over the past 10 fiscal years was at its highest in FY2018, in inflation-adjusted terms, funding for FY2018 was lower than it was in FY2010.\nIncreased funding for CJS coincides with the increase to the discretionary budget caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ). The BCA put into effect statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2012-FY2021. Under the act, discretionary spending limits were scheduled to be adjusted downward each fiscal year until FY2021. However, legislation was enacted that increased discretionary spending caps for FY2014 to FY2018. A sequestration of discretionary funding, ordered pursuant to the BCA, cut nearly $4 billion out of the total amount Congress and the President provided for CJS for FY2013. Since then, funding for CJS has increased as more discretionary funding has been allowed under the BCA. \n Figure 2 shows total CJS funding for FY2009-FY2018 by major component (i.e., the Departments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, and the NSF). Increases in CJS funding in FY2009 (not including ARRA funding) and FY2010 largely resulted from more funding for the Department of Commerce in support of the 2010 decennial census, though there were small increases during that same time in funding for DOJ, NASA, and NSF. \nAlthough decreased appropriations for the Department of Commerce mostly explain the overall decrease in CJS appropriations from FY2010 to FY2013 (a 47.4% reduction), cuts in funding for DOJ (-8.7%) and NASA (-9.8%) also contributed. Funding for NSF held relatively steady from FY2010 to FY2013.\nOverall CJS funding has increased since FY2014, and this is partially explained by more funding for the Department of Commerce to help the Census Bureau prepare for the 2020 decennial census. However, over this time period there have also been steady increases in funding for DOJ (+9.5%), NASA (+18.0%), and NSF (+8.5%), as higher discretionary spending caps have been used to provide additional funding to these agencies. Also, the increase in funding for the Department of Commerce is not solely due to more funding for the Census Bureau. Funding has increased for other agencies within the department, such as NOAA (+18.7%) and NIST (+$41.0%).\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "This report describes actions taken by the Trump Administration and Congress to provide FY2019 funding for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) accounts. It also provides an overview of enacted FY2018 funding for agencies and bureaus funded as part of annual CJS appropriations acts.\nThe Administration requested $66.555 billion for CJS for FY2019. The request included $9.797 billion for the Department of Commerce, $28.835 billion for the Department of Justice (DOJ), $27.372 billion for the science agencies, and $551 million for the related agencies. The Administration's budget proposed eliminating funding for several CJS agencies and accounts. The Administration proposed moving funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program from the Office of National Drug Control Policy to the Drug Enforcement Administration, closing the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office and moving its responsibilities to the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), and a new account structure for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\nThe bill reported by the House Committee on Appropriations (H.R. 5952) would have provided a total of $73.923 billion for CJS for FY2019. The bill would have provided $12.106 billion for the Department of Commerce, $31.113 billion for DOJ, $29.728 billion for the science agencies, and $976 million for the related agencies. The committee largely declined to adopt many of the Administration's proposals to eliminate funding for several CJS agencies and accounts, though the committee-reported bill would have moved funding for the COPS program to OJP and it included the Administration's proposed account structure for NASA.\nThe bill reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations (S. 3072) would have provided a total of $72.648 billion for CJS for FY2019. The bill would have provided $11.572 billion for the Department of Commerce, $30.699 billion for DOJ, $29.400 billion for the science agencies, and $977 million for the related agencies. The Senate Committee on Appropriations largely declined to adopt many of the proposals put forth by the Administration in its FY2019 budget. Unlike the Administration's request and the House committee-reported bill, S. 3072 would have funded the COPS program through its own account and the committee did not include the Administration's new account structure for NASA.\nFY2019 enacted funding for CJS is $72.908 billion. This amount includes $11.414 billion for the Department of Commerce, $30.934 billion for DOJ, $29.583 billion for the science agencies, and $977 million for the related agencies. In general, FY2019 funding for CJS is in-line with FY2018 enacted funding, with a few notable exceptions. These include increased funding for the Census Bureau to help ramp up operations for the 2020 decennial census, increased funding for DOJ's law enforcement agencies and the federal prisons system, and increased funding for several NASA accounts.\nFor FY2018, Congress and the President provided a total of $72.119 billion in funding for CJS. This included $70.921 billion in regular funding provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) and $1.198 billion in emergency-designated funding provided in the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-123).",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nT he U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers several programs designed to help farmers and ranchers recover from the financial effects of natural disasters, including (1) federal crop insurance, (2) the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), (3) livestock and fruit tree disaster programs, and (4) emergency disaster loans for both crop and livestock producers. All have permanent authorization, while the emergency loan program is the only one requiring a federal disaster designation (see Table 1 ). Most programs receive mandatory funding amounts of \"such sums as necessary\" and are not subject to annual discretionary appropriations. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 farm bill, P.L. 115-334 ) made a number of amendments to these programs, generally to expand availability and support.\nPrior to the creation of many of the permanently authorized programs at USDA, Congress had historically provided farmers and ranchers with ad hoc disaster assistance payments authorized through supplemental appropriations. Subsequently, policies shifted away from the temporary forms of assistance in favor of enacting more permanent forms of support. More recently, policies have shifted to supplement permanent programs with ad hoc assistance for select agriculture losses. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-123 ) amended existing disaster assistance programs and authorized $2.36 billion for production losses from hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 that were not covered by existing programs. \nThis report provides an overview of permanently authorized federal disaster assistance programs for agricultural losses as well as discretionary authority that USDA may use to provide assistance. Recent amendments in the 2018 farm bill and ad hoc assistance authorized by Congress in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 are also discussed. \n\n\tFederal Crop Insurance\n\nThe federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq. ), and is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA). The program is designed to protect crop producers from risks associated with adverse weather, as well as weather-related plant diseases and insect infestations and declines in commodity prices.\nCrop insurance is available for most major crops and many specialty crops (including fruit, tree nut, vegetable, and nursery crops), as well as forage and pastureland for livestock producers. A producer who chooses to purchase an insurance policy must do so by an administratively determined deadline date, which varies by crop and usually coincides with the planting season. Insurance products that protect against loss in revenue and profit margins are also available. Policies are typically available in major growing regions. \nThe federal crop insurance program was instituted in the 1930s and was subject to major legislative reforms in 1980 and again in 1994 and 2000. The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-224 ) authorized new federal spending for the program primarily through more generous premium subsidies to help make the program more affordable to farmers and enhance farmer participation levels in an effort to preclude the need for ad hoc emergency disaster payments. \nUnder the current crop insurance program, a producer who grows an insurable crop selects a level of crop yield and price coverage and pays a premium that increases as the levels of yield and price coverage rise. However, all eligible producers can receive catastrophic (CAT) coverage without paying a premium. The premium for this portion of coverage is completely subsidized by the federal government. Under CAT coverage, participating producers can receive a payment equal to 55% of the estimated market price of the commodity on crop losses in excess of 50% of normal yield\u2014referred to as 50/55 coverage.\nAlthough eligible producers do not have to pay a premium for CAT coverage, they are required to pay upon enrollment a $655 administrative fee per covered crop for each county where they grow the crop. USDA can waive the fee for financial hardship cases. In addition to the administrative fee, producers can elect to pay a premium, which is partially subsidized by the government, to increase the 50/55 CAT coverage to any equivalent level of coverage between 50/100 and 85/100 (i.e., 85% of yield and 100% of the estimated market price) in increments of 5%. These higher levels of coverage are known as \"buy up\" coverage.\nFor many insurable commodities, an eligible producer can purchase revenue insurance. Under such a policy, a farmer could receive an indemnity payment when actual farm revenue for a crop falls below the target level of revenue, regardless of whether the shortfall in revenue was caused by poor production or low farm commodity prices. Insured producers are also eligible for reduced coverage if they are late or prevented from planting because of flooding. \nThe annual agriculture appropriations bill traditionally makes two separate appropriations for the federal crop insurance program. It provides discretionary funding for the salaries and expenses of the RMA. It also provides \"such sums as are necessary\" for the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, which finances all other expenses of the program, including premium subsidies, indemnity payments, and reimbursements to the private insurance companies. The total cost of the program varies by year, primarily due to fluctuating levels of indemnity payments from changes in commodity prices, planting decisions, and weather conditions. Across all policies, the average premium subsidy was about 63% of total premiums in 2017. The federal government also subsidizes the costs of selling and servicing the policies (as delivery subsidies to Approved Insurance Providers) and absorbs underwriting losses (indemnities in excess of premiums received) in years when indemnities are high.\nFor a more detailed analysis of the federal crop insurance program, see CRS Report R45193, Federal Crop Insurance: Program Overview for the 115th Congress .\n\n\tNoninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP)\n\nProducers who grow a crop that is currently ineligible for crop insurance may apply for NAP. NAP has permanent authority under Section 196 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 7333) and is administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA). It was first authorized under the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-354 ). NAP is not subject to annual appropriations. Instead, it receives such sums as are necessary through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which has a line of credit with the U.S. Treasury to fund an array of farm programs.\nEligible crops under NAP include any commercial crops grown for food, fiber, or livestock consumption for which there is no CAT coverage available under the federal crop insurance program, with limited exceptions. These crops include mushrooms, floriculture, ornamental nursery, Christmas trees, turfgrass sod, aquaculture, honey, maple sap, ginseng, and industrial crops used in manufacturing or grown as a feedstock for energy production, among others. Trees grown for wood, paper, or pulp products are not eligible. To be eligible for a NAP payment, a producer first must apply for coverage by the application closing date, which varies by crop but is generally about 30 days prior to the final planting date for an annual crop. Like CAT coverage under crop insurance, NAP applicants must also pay an administrative fee at the time of application. The NAP service fee is the lesser of $325 per crop or $825 per producer per administrative county, not to exceed a total of $1,950 for farms in multiple counties. \nIn order to receive a NAP payment, a producer must experience at least a 50% crop loss caused by a natural disaster or be prevented from planting more than 35% of intended crop acreage. For any losses in excess of the minimum loss threshold, a producer can receive 55% of the average market price for the covered commodity. Hence, NAP is similar to CAT coverage in that it pays 55% of the market price for losses in excess of 50% of normal historical production. \nAdditional coverage (referred to as buy-up coverage) may be purchased at 50% to 65% (in 5% increments) of established yield and 100% of average market price, contract price, or other premium price. The farmer-paid fee for additional coverage is 5.25% times the product of the selected coverage level and value of production (acreage times yield times average market price times the producer's share of the crop). Grazing land is not eligible for buy-up coverage.\nA producer of a noninsured crop is subject to an annual payment limit of $125,000 per person for catastrophic coverage and $300,000 for buy-up coverage. A producer is ineligible under NAP if the producer's total adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds $900,000. The total federal cost of NAP was $165 million in FY2014, $125 million in FY2015, $137 million in FY2016, $157 million in FY2017, and $164.3 million in FY2018.\n\n\tSupplemental Agricultural Disaster Assistance Programs\n\nFour agricultural disaster assistance programs are permanently authorized for livestock and fruit trees: (1) the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP); (2) the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP); (3) the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP); and (4) the Tree Assistance Program (TAP). They operate nationwide and are administered by FSA. Producers do not pay fees to participate and can apply at their local FSA offices.\nAll programs receive \"such sums as necessary\" in mandatory funding via the CCC to reimburse eligible producers for their losses. Total payments vary each year based on eligible loss conditions. For FY2018, LFP payments totaled $487.5 million, LIP payments totaled $36.6 million, TAP payments totaled $11.3 million, and ELAP payments totaled $47 million. All payments are reduced by sequestration.\nFor individual producers, payments under LFP may not exceed $125,000 per year. There are no limits on the amount of payments received under LIP, ELAP, and TAP. To be eligible for a payment under any of these programs, a producer's total AGI cannot exceed $900,000.\n\n\t\tLivestock Indemnity Program (LIP)\n\nLIP provides payments to eligible livestock owners and contract growers for livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality caused by an eligible loss condition (e.g., adverse weather, disease, or animal attack). Payments may also be made when the animal is injured as a direct result of an eligible loss condition but does not die and is sold at a reduced price. Eligible loss conditions may include (1) extreme or abnormal damaging weather that is not expected to occur during the loss period for which it occurred, (2) disease that is caused or transmitted by a vector and is not susceptible to control by vaccination, and (3) an attack by animals reintroduced into the wild by the federal government or protected by federal law. Eligibility is predicated on not only the occurrence of an eligible loss condition but direct causation to the death of the animal.\nEligible livestock include beef and dairy cattle, bison, hogs, chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, sheep, goats, alpacas, deer, elk, emus, llamas, reindeer, caribou, and equine. The livestock must have been maintained for commercial use and not produced for reasons other than commercial use as part of a farming operation. The program excludes wild free-roaming animals, pets, and animals used for recreational purposes, such as hunting, roping, or for show. Poultry and swine are the only eligible livestock for contract growers.\nThe LIP payment rate is equal to 75% of the average fair market value of the deceased animal type. USDA publishes a payment rate for each type of livestock for each year (e.g., $983.90 per adult beef cow and $4.39 per duck in 2018). For eligible livestock contract growers, the payment rate is based on 75% of the national average input costs for the applicable livestock. For livestock sold at a reduced sale price, payments are calculated by multiplying the national payment rate for the livestock category minus the amount the owner received at sale times the owner's share.\n\n\t\tLivestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP)\n\nLFP makes payments to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses on drought-affected pastureland (including cropland planted specifically for grazing), or on rangeland managed by a federal agency due to a qualifying fire. \nEligible producers must own, cash or share lease, or be a contract grower of covered livestock during the 60 calendar days before the beginning date of a qualifying drought or fire. They must also provide pastureland or grazing land for covered livestock that is either (a) physically located in a county affected by a qualifying drought during the normal grazing period for the county or (b) managed by a federal agency where grazing is not permitted due to fire. \nEligible livestock types are livestock that have been grazing on eligible grazing land or pastureland or would have been had a disaster not struck. These include alpacas, beef cattle, buffalo, beefalo, dairy cattle, sheep, deer, elk, emus, equine, goats, llamas, poultry, reindeer, and swine. Livestock must be maintained for commercial use as part of a farming operation. Livestock owned for noncommercial uses, or livestock that is in (or would have been in) feedlots, are excluded. \nPayments are generally triggered by the drought intensity level for an individual county as published in the U.S. Drought Monitor, a federal report published each week. The number of monthly payments depends on the drought severity and length of time the county has been designated as such ( Table 2 ). For drought, the payment amount is equal to the number of monthly payments times 60% of estimated monthly feed cost. For producers who sold livestock because of drought conditions, the payment rate is equal to 80% of the estimated monthly feed cost.\n\n\t\tEmergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP)\n\nELAP provides payments to producers of livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish as compensation for losses due to disease, adverse weather, feed or water shortages, or other conditions (such as wildfires) that are not covered under LIP or LFP. \nELAP specifically provides assistance for the loss of honey bee colonies in excess of normal mortality. In order to meet the eligibility requirements for honey bee colony losses, they must be the direct result of an eligible adverse weather or loss condition such as colony collapse disorder, eligible winter storm, excessive wind, and flood. For livestock losses, ELAP covers four categories: (1) livestock death losses caused by an eligible loss condition, (2) livestock feed and grazing losses that are not due to drought or wildfires on federally managed lands, (3) losses resulting from the additional cost of transporting water to livestock due to an eligible drought, and (4) losses resulting from the additional cost associated with gathering livestock for inspection and treatment related to cattle tick fever. \n\n\t\tTree Assistance Program (TAP)\n\nTAP makes payments to qualifying orchardists and nursery tree growers to replant or rehabilitate trees, bushes, and vines damaged by natural disasters. Losses in crop production\u2014as opposed to the tree, bush, or vine itself\u2014are generally covered by federal crop insurance or NAP. Eligible trees, bushes, and vines are those from which an annual crop is produced for commercial purposes. Nursery trees include ornamental, fruit, nut, and Christmas trees produced for commercial sale. Trees used for pulp or timber are ineligible.\nTo be considered an eligible loss, the individual stand must have sustained a mortality loss or damage loss in excess of 15% after adjustment for normal mortality or damage. Normal mortality or damage is determined based on (a) each eligible disaster event, except for losses due to plant disease, or (b) for plant disease, the time period for which the stand is infected. Also, the loss could not have been prevented through reasonable and available measures.\nFor replacement, replanting, and/or rehabilitation of trees, bushes, or vines, the payment calculation is the lesser of (a) 65% of the actual cost of replanting (in excess of 15% mortality) and/or 50% of the actual cost of rehabilitation (in excess of 15% damage), or (b) the maximum eligible amount established for the practice by FSA. The total quantity of acres planted to trees, bushes, or vines for which a producer can receive TAP payments cannot exceed 1,000 acres annually.\n\n\tEmergency Disaster Loans\n\nWhen either the President or the Secretary of Agriculture declares a county a disaster area or quarantine area, agricultural producers in that county may become eligible for low-interest emergency disaster (EM) loans available through FSA. Producers in counties that are contiguous to a county with a disaster designation also become eligible for EM loans. EM loan funds may be used to help eligible farmers, ranchers, and aquaculture producers recover from production losses (when the producer suffers a significant loss of an annual crop) or from physical losses (such as repairing or replacing damaged or destroyed structures or equipment or for the replanting of permanent crops such as orchards). A qualified applicant can then borrow up to 100% of actual production or physical losses (not to exceed $500,000). \nOnce a county is declared eligible, an individual producer within the county (or a contiguous county) must also meet the following requirements for an EM loan: A producer must (1) be an established family farmer and a citizen or permanent resident of the United States; (2) experience a crop loss of more than 30% or a physical loss of livestock, livestock products, real estate, or property; and (3) be unable to obtain credit from a commercial lender but still show the potential to repay the loan, including having acceptable credit history and collateral to secure the loan. Applications must be received within eight months of the county's disaster designation date. Loans for nonreal-estate purposes must generally be repaid within seven years. Loans for physical losses to real estate have terms up to 20 years. Depending on the repayment ability of the producer and other circumstances, these terms can be extended to 20 years for nonreal-estate losses and up to 40 years for real estate losses.\nThe EM loan program is permanently authorized by Title III of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (P.L. 87-128), as amended, and is subject to annual appropriations. In FY2018, the program received $25.6 million of new loan authority. Unused funds are carried over and available in the next fiscal year. Therefore, the total loan authority can vary greatly depending on appropriated levels, annual use, and total carryover. In FY2019, the total loan authority is $99.5 million.\nAlso in counties with disaster designations, producers who have existing direct loans with FSA may be eligible for Disaster Set-Aside. If, as a result of disaster, a borrower is unable to pay all expenses and make loan payments that are coming due, up to one full year's payment can be moved to the end of the loan.\n\n\tOther USDA Assistance\n\nUSDA also has several permanent disaster assistance programs that help producers repair damaged land following natural disasters. It also has authority to issue disaster payments to farmers with \"Section 32\" or \"CCC\" funds and can use a variety of existing programs to address disaster issues as they arise. \n\n\t\tEmergency Agricultural Land Assistance Programs\n\nSeveral USDA programs offer financial and technical assistance to producers to repair, restore, and mitigate damage by a natural disaster on private land. \nThe Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) are administered by FSA. For both programs, FSA pays participants a percentage of the cost to restore the land to a productive state. ECP also funds water for livestock and installing water conserving measures during times of drought. EFRP was created to assist private forestland owners with losses caused by a natural disaster on nonindustrial private forest land. The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program and the EWP floodplain easement program are administered by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service and the U.S. Forest Service. EWP assists sponsors, landowners, and operators in implementing emergency recovery measures for runoff retardation and erosion prevention to relieve imminent hazards to life and property created by a natural disaster. The EWP floodplain easement program is a mitigation program that pays for permanent easements on private land meant to safeguard lives and property from future floods and drought and the products of erosion. \nFor more information on these programs, see CRS Report R42854, Emergency Assistance for Agricultural Land Rehabilitation .\n\n\t\t\"Section 32\" and \"CCC\" Funds for Farm Disaster Payments\n\nUSDA has discretionary authority to distribute emergency payments to farmers with \"Section 32\" and CCC funds. While both Section 32 and CCC have broad authority to support U.S. agriculture, the majority of their activities are required under various statutes, such as omnibus farm bills. Beginning in FY2012, annual appropriations acts limited USDA's discretionary use of CCC and Section 32. The FY2018 omnibus appropriation removed this limitation for CCC and allowed for limited carryover funding under Section 32 to be used pending congressional notification.\nUSDA's Section 32 program is funded by a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous year's customs receipts, and funds are used for a variety of activities, including child nutrition programs, the purchase of commodities for domestic food programs, and farm disaster assistance. The statutory authority is Section 32 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act Amendment of 1935 (P.L. 74-320, 7 U.S.C. 612c). The authority to provide disaster assistance is attributed to clause 3 of Section 32, which provides that funds \"shall be used to re-establish farmers' purchasing power by making payments in connections with the normal production.\" The FY2019 omnibus (\u00a7714, P.L. 116-6 ) limits clause 3 to carryover funding of no more than $350 million following a two-week advance notice to Congress. The CCC serves as the funding institution for carrying out federal farm support programs, such as commodity price support and production programs, conservation programs, disaster assistance, agricultural research, and bioenergy development. It is federally chartered by the CCC Charter Act of 1948 (P.L. 80-806), as amended. The authority to provide disaster assistance is attributed to Section 5 of the act (15 U.S.C. 714c), which, among other activities, authorizes the CCC to support the prices of agricultural commodities through loans, purchases, payments, and other operations.\n\n\t\tAdjustments to Existing USDA Programs\n\nIn addition to implementing the disaster assistance programs discussed above, USDA can use authority under other existing programs to help producers recover from natural disasters. For example, in response to the major drought affecting a large part of the United States in recent years, USDA took a number of administrative actions to assist producers, including\nextending emergency grazing and haying on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres; reducing the emergency loan interest rate and making emergency loans available earlier in the season; targeting conservation assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program for the most extreme and exceptional drought areas; additional funding helps farmers and ranchers implement conservation practices that conserve water resources, reduce wind erosion on drought-impacted fields, and improve livestock access to water (farmers and ranchers contribute about half the cost of implementing the practices); and directing Emergency Community Water Assistance Grants for rural water systems experiencing emergencies resulting from a significant decline in quantity or quality of drinking water. \n\n\t\tAssistance to Prevent Spread of Animal Diseases\n\nUnder the Animal Health Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 8301, et seq. ), USDA is authorized to take protective actions against the spread of livestock disease, including seizing, treating, or destroying animals if USDA determines that an extraordinary emergency exists because of the presence of a pest or disease of livestock. As part of its animal health program, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service compensates producers for animals that must be euthanized, for their disposition, and for infected materials that must also be destroyed. Funding is provided by annual appropriations or through the CCC for larger amounts. The most recent example of a large-scale outbreak that resulted in payments to producers was in 2015 and 2016 during outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza affecting the U.S. poultry industry. \n\n\tAmendments in the 2018 Farm Bill\n\nThe 2018 farm bill amended the supplemental disaster assistance programs as well as NAP, crop insurance, and emergency loans. The following provides a summary of changes to select programs included in this report. For a more comprehensive review of amendments under the 2018 farm bill, see CRS Report R45525, The 2018 Farm Bill (P.L. 115-334): Summary and Side-by-Side Comparison .\n\n\t\tFederal Crop Insurance Amendments\n\nThe 2018 farm bill generally expands coverage under the federal crop insurance program, including for forage, grazing, and hemp. Amendments authorize catastrophic level coverage for insurance plans covering grazing crops and grasses. It also allows producers to purchase separate crop insurance policies for crops that can be both grazed and mechanically harvested on the same acres during the same growing season and to receive independent indemnities for each intended use. A number of amendments were also made related to hemp, including eligibility, post-harvest losses, and waivers that allow for the development of policies for hemp. For all crops, the administrative fee for catastrophic coverage was increased from $300 to $655 per crop per county.\n\n\t\tNAP Amendments\n\nThe 2018 farm bill expands crop eligibility to include crops that may be covered by select forms of crop insurance but only under whole farm plans or weather index policies. It also amends the payment calculation to consider the producer's share of the crop, raises the service fees, and creates separate payment limits for catastrophic ($125,000/person) and buy-up ($300,000/person) coverage. Payments under buy-up coverage are also expanded to include other premium prices (e.g., local, organic, or direct market price), which may be higher than the average market price. The law makes buy-up coverage permanent and adds data collection and program coordination requirements. \n\n\t\tSupplemental Agriculture Disaster Assistance Program Amendments\n\nThe 2018 farm bill expands payments for livestock losses caused by disease and for losses of unweaned livestock that occur before vaccination. The law also expands the definition of eligible producer to include Indian tribes or tribal organizations and increases replanting and rehabilitation payment rates for beginning and veteran orchardists. The law amends the limits on payments received under select disaster assistance programs: Of the four disaster assistance programs, only LFP is now subject to the $125,000/person payment limit.\n\n\t\tEmergency Loan Amendments\n\nEligibility is expanded to allow borrowers who have received a debt write-down or restructuring of a farm loan (due to circumstances beyond the control of the borrower) to maintain eligibility for an emergency loan.\n\n\tAd Hoc Assistance\n\nThe U.S. farm policy mix that provides assistance to agricultural producers for damage and loss following a natural disaster continues to shift between permanent and temporary authorized support. The authorization of permanent disaster assistance programs in the 2008 and 2014 farm bills, as well as expanded crop insurance and NAP policies, were designed to reduce the need for ad hoc disaster assistance. Following enactment of the 2008 farm bill, Congress appropriated little in the way of supplemental disaster assistance for agriculture, most of which was for land rehabilitation efforts under EWP and ECP. This changed in 2018, when an active hurricane and wildfire season in 2017 resulted in the authorization of supplemental assistance in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. In addition to the programmatic changes discussed in the \" Supplemental Agricultural Disaster Assistance Programs \" section of this report, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also authorized $2.36 billion for production losses not covered under NAP or crop insurance.\n\n\t\t2017 Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program\n\nOn July 16, 2018, USDA announced the availability of the bulk of the 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act funding through the Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program (WHIP). Only crop, tree, bush, and vine losses from a wildfire or hurricane in 2017 are eligible for assistance under WHIP.\nPayments to producers who purchased crop insurance or NAP coverage range from 70% to 95% of the expected value of the crop, depending on the level of coverage purchased. For producers who did not purchase crop insurance or NAP in advance of the natural disaster, payments under WHIP are limited to 65% of expected value of the crop. All payments are reduced by the value of the crop harvested, if any, and any insurance indemnity paid through crop insurance or NAP. All participants are required to purchase crop insurance or NAP for the next two years. \nPayments are limited to $125,000 if less than 75% of the participant's AGI is from farming. If more than 75% of the participant's AGI is from farming, then payments are limited to a maximum of $900,000. USDA's initial announcement stated that only 50% of the participant's payment rate will be made up front, with additional payments possible depending on fund availability.\n\n\t\tFlorida Citrus Block Grant\n\nUSDA used a portion of the 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act funding for a $340 million block grant to the state of Florida. Under the grant, the state is expected to assist the citrus industry with the cost of buying and planting replacement trees\u2014including resetting and grove rehabilitation\u2014and for repairing damage to irrigation systems, among other activities.\n\n\t\tPecan Trees\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ), also provided supplemental assistance but through an existing program\u2014TAP. The act authorized $15 million for payments to eligible pecan orchardists or pecan nursery tree growers for mortality losses incurred during calendar year 2017. The act lowers the mortality loss threshold under TAP to cover losses in excess of 7.5% but not more than 15%, adjusted for normal mortality. If losses exceeded 15%, then the loss is already eligible for TAP. If applications for these losses (i.e., between 7.5% and 15%) exceed the available $15 million, then payments would be proportionally reduced.\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers several programs to help farmers recover financially from natural disasters, including drought and floods. All the programs have permanent authorization, and one requires a federal disaster designation (the emergency loan program). Most programs receive mandatory funding amounts that are \"such sums as necessary\" and are not subject to annual discretionary appropriations.\nThe federal crop insurance program offers subsidized policies designed to protect crop producers from risks associated with adverse weather, as well as weather-related plant diseases and insect infestations and declines in commodity prices. Policies must be purchased prior to the planting season. Eligible commodities include most major crops and many specialty crops (including fruit, tree nut, vegetable, and nursery crops), as well as forage and pastureland for livestock producers. Producers who grow a crop that is currently ineligible for crop insurance may apply for the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). NAP provides a catastrophic level of coverage, as well as options to purchase additional coverage. Similar to crop insurance, policies must be purchased prior to the planting season.\nThere are four permanently reauthorized disaster programs for livestock and trees. Producers do not pay a fee to participate, and advanced sign-up is not required. The programs are:\n1. the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), which provides payments to eligible livestock owners and contract growers at a rate of 75% of market value for livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality or sold at a reduced sale price caused by adverse weather, attacks by reintroduced wild animals, and disease; 2. the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), which makes payments to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses on drought-affected pasture or grazing land or on rangeland managed by a federal agency due to a qualifying fire; 3. the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), which provides payments to producers of livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish as compensation for losses due to disease, adverse weather, and feed or water shortages; and 4. the Tree Assistance Program (TAP), which makes payments to orchardists/nursery tree growers for losses in excess of 15% to replant trees, bushes, and vines damaged by natural disasters.\nSeparately, for all types of farms and ranches, when a county has been declared a disaster area by either the President or the Secretary of Agriculture, producers in that county may become eligible for low-interest emergency disaster loans.\nUSDA has several permanent disaster assistance programs designed to help producers repair damaged land following natural disasters. It also has authority to issue disaster payments to farmers with funds from \"Section 32,\" or the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Finally, USDA can use a variety of existing programs to address disaster issues as they arise, such as allowing emergency grazing on land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program.\nThe Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334) made a number of amendments to the permanent farm bill disaster assistance programs, NAP, and crop insurance, including changes to payment limits, definitions, eligibility, and coverage.",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nIntroduction\n\nThis report provides background information on the types of water supply and wastewater treatment projects traditionally funded by the federal government and the several existing programs to assist communities with water supply and wastewater treatment. \nFor more than four decades, Congress has authorized and refined several programs to help communities address water supply and wastewater problems. The agencies that administer these programs differ in multiple ways. For example, in terms of funding mechanisms, projects developed by the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) typically require direct, individual project authorizations from Congress. \nIn contrast, standing program authorizations provide project funding for other agencies, including\nthe Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\nThe key practical difference is that with the individual project authorizations there is no predictable assistance, or even guarantee of funding after a project is authorized, because funding must be secured each year in the congressional appropriations process. The programs, on the other hand, have set program criteria, are generally funded from year to year, and provide a process under which project sponsors compete for funding.\nIn terms of scope and mission, the primary responsibilities of USACE are to maintain inland navigation, provide for flood and storm damage reduction, and restore aquatic ecosystems, while EPA's mission relates to protecting public health and the environment. Further, the Department of Commerce and HUD focus on community and economic development. Likewise, the specific programs discussed in this report\u2014while all address water supply and wastewater treatment to some degree\u2014differ in important respects. Some are national in scope (those of USDA, EPA, and the Department of Commerce, for example), while others are regionally focused (Reclamation's programs and projects). Some focus primarily on urban areas (HUD), some on rural areas (USDA). \nFor each of the projects and programs discussed, this report describes purposes, financing mechanisms, eligibility requirements, recent funding, and statutory/regulatory authority. The report does not address special projects and programs aimed specifically at assisting Indian Tribes, Alaskan Native Villages, and c olonias , or other regional programs such as those associated with the Appalachian region or U.S. Territories.\nThis report focuses on municipal and industrial (M&I) water and wastewater activities. This report does not address projects and programs that involve irrigation, flood control, power supply, and recreation. However, in some cases (noted below), a federal program (e.g., Reclamation) may primarily support one or more of these other objectives while providing some support for M&I activities, even if only incidentally. \nOther federal authorities of USDA's Rural Utilities Service, Reclamation, and USACE may be available to assist with the provision of emergency water and wastewater needs, such as improving access to water supplies during a drought. These authorities are not discussed in this report.\n Table 1 summarizes financial and other key elements of the projects and program activities discussed in this report. As indicated in the table, federal funding for the programs and projects discussed in this report varies greatly. Collectively, congressional funding for these programs in recent years has been somewhat eroded by overall competition among the many programs that are supported by discretionary spending, despite the continuing pressure from stakeholders and others for increased funding. While federal support for some traditional financing tools\u2014project grants, formula grants, capitalization grants, direct and guaranteed loans\u2014has declined, policymakers have begun to consider alternative financing approaches, such as trust funds, new types of federal loans, and options to encourage private sector investments in water infrastructure through public-private partnerships. Supporters of some of these newer ideas (e.g., the \" Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Program \") see them as options to supplement or complement, but not replace, traditional financing tools. \nState and local contributions are the most significant source of total funds available to communities for drinking water and wastewater treatment improvements. According to the Congressional Budget Office, spending by state and local governments on drinking water and wastewater has increased much faster than spending by the federal government, especially since the mid-1970s. In 2017, the state and local share of such projects (both capital and operation and maintenance spending) was 96%, while the federal share was 4%.\n\n\tDepartment of the Interior\n\n\t\tBureau of Reclamation\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) was established to implement the Reclamation Act of 1902, which authorized the construction of water works to provide water for irrigation in arid western states. Reclamation owns and manages 475 dams and 337 reservoirs, which are capable of storing 245 million acre-feet of water. The agency's inventory of 4,000 \"constructed real property assets\" has a current replacement value of nearly $100 billion. Overall, these facilities serve approximately 31 million people, delivering a total of approximately 28.5 million acre-feet of water (an acre-foot is enough to cover one acre of land one foot deep, or 325,851 gallons) annually in nondrought years. Reclamation-funded municipal and industrial (M&I) water deliveries total approximately 2.8 million acre-feet and have more than doubled since 1970. \nReclamation primarily manages M&I water supply facilities as part of larger, multipurpose reclamation projects serving irrigation, flood control, power supply, and recreation purposes. However, since 1980, Congress has individually authorized construction of \"rural water supply\" projects, as well as reclamation wastewater and reuse/recycling projects. This title also authorized Reclamation to undertake specific and general feasibility studies for reclamation wastewater and reuse projects and to research, construct, and operate demonstration projects. Even so, these projects remain a small part of the overall Reclamation portfolio.\nHistorically, Reclamation constructed projects with federal funds, then established a repayment schedule based on the amount of total construction costs allocated to specific project purposes. Reclamation project authorizations typically require 100% repayment, with interest, for the M&I portion of water supply facilities, which makes Reclamation assistance a de facto long-term loan. However, for M&I projects under rural water and Title XVI authorities, Congress has authorized terms providing some or all federal funding for projects on a nonreimbursable basis (i.e. a de facto grant). For example, the federal government fully funds rural water projects serving Indian populations. For non-Indian rural water supply projects, Congress has authorized nonreimbursable federal funding of as much as 75%-85% of project costs. The federal share of costs for Title XVI projects is generally much lower than for rural water projects; it is limited to a maximum of 25% of total project costs or, for projects authorized since 1996, a maximum of $20 million per project authorization. \n\n\t\t\t\"Traditional\" Multipurpose Reclamation Projects9\n\nUnlike many other programs described in this report, Reclamation undertakes projects largely at the explicit direction of Congress. Local project sponsors may approach Reclamation or Congress with proposals for project construction and funding; however, except where blanket feasibility study authorizations exist\u2014for example, for certain program areas described below\u2014specific project feasibility studies must be first authorized by Congress. Once a feasibility study is completed, congressional authorization is typically sought prior to construction. Because there is no \"program\" per se, there are no clear and concise eligibility or program criteria for selecting large, multipurpose projects. Rather, Congress relies on information provided in feasibility studies, including cost-benefit, engineering, and environmental analyses, and political considerations.\n\n\t\t\t\tProject Purposes\n\nIndividual authorization statutes establish project purposes. Generally, M&I projects are part of larger, multipurpose projects such as those built for irrigation water supply, flood control, and hydro power purposes, or are authorized under the rural water supply or Title XVI water reuse programs described below. \n\n\t\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nProjects are financed and constructed up front by the federal government, and costs for M&I portions of such projects are generally scheduled to be repaid 100%, with interest, via \"repayment\" or \"water service\" contracts. Irrigation districts must also repay their share of project benefits, but such payments are not subject to interest charges.\n\n\t\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nGenerally, local governments and organizations such as irrigation, water, or conservation districts may approach Reclamation and/or Congress for project support. All construction project funding must be appropriated by Congress. As noted earlier, Reclamation only works on projects located in the 17 western states (32 Stat. 388; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7391 et seq. ), unless otherwise specifically authorized. \n\n\t\t\t\tFunding\n\nFunding information for the M&I portions of multipurpose projects is not readily available. Total regular Reclamation appropriations (gross current authority; not including permanent funding) for FY2019 were $1.571 billion. The total FY2020 budget request for Reclamation was $1.109 billion. \n\n\t\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nReclamation generally carries out its water supply activities in 17 western states as authorized by the Reclamation Act of 1902, as amended (32 Stat. 388; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7391 et seq. ), as well as through hundreds of individual project authorization statutes. \n\n\t\t\tRural Water Supply Projects\n\nSimilar to its traditional multipurpose projects, Reclamation has undertaken individual rural water projects largely at the explicit direction of Congress. Generally speaking, Congress has in most cases prioritized appropriation of funding for already authorized projects rather than funds for new rural water construction projects.\nIn lieu of the project-based approach to authorizing new rural water projects, in 2006 Congress authorized a rural water supply program ( P.L. 109-451 ). Under the program, Reclamation was authorized to work with rural communities and Indian tribes to identify municipal and industrial water needs and options to address such needs through appraisal investigations, and in some cases feasibility studies. In 2008, Reclamation published an interim final rule establishing future program criteria. According to the bureau, between 2006 and 2016, it used this authority to study approximately 26 projects to varying extents, although no projects were recommended for construction and authorized by Congress. This authority expired at the end of FY2016 and has not been renewed since. However, Reclamation continues to pursue authorized rural water projects that were previously authorized at the project level. As of early 2019, Reclamation reported that $1.3 billion was still needed to construct authorized, ongoing rural water projects.\n\n\t\t\t\tProject Purposes\n\nHistorically, individual authorization statutes established rural water project purposes. Nearly half of the rural water supply projects authorized to date are somehow connected to previously authorized irrigation facilities under the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program (PSMBP), or otherwise related to water service anticipated but not received under earlier PSMBP authorizations. Many rural water project authorizations are also linked to Indian water settlements or otherwise provide benefits to Indian tribes.\n\n\t\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nProjects are generally cost-shared between the federal government and local sponsors. In the past, the federal cost-share for these projects has averaged 64%, and ranged from 15% to 80% for non-Indian rural water supply projects. As previously noted, the federal government pays up to 100% of the cost of Indian rural water supply projects. Assistance is generally provided on a competitive basis under the interim final rule's financial criteria. In accordance with the programmatic criteria provided in the rule, a nonfederal cost-share would be required, consistent with any future construction authorization for those projects.\n\n\t\t\t\tEligibility Requirements15\n\nLocal governments and organizations such as water and conservation districts or associations, including Indian tribes, may approach Reclamation and/or Congress for project support. Currently, all construction project funding must be authorized at the project level and appropriated by Congress. As noted earlier, Reclamation only works on projects located in the 17 western states (32 Stat. 388; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7391 et seq. ), unless specifically authorized by Congress. \nReclamation previously published an interim final rule (43 C.F.R. Part 404) that established criteria for developing new rural supply projects, but the authority for the program has since expired. The rule does not apply to previously authorized projects. As previously stated, ongoing rural water construction activities are limited to ongoing, previously authorized projects.\n\n\t\t\t\tFunding\n\nEnacted funding for rural water supply projects in FY2019 was $132.7 million. This included $98 million in additional funding above the Administration's FY2019 budget request to be allocated at the project level by Reclamation in a subsequent work plan for FY2019. For FY2020, the Administration's budget proposal requested $27.7 million for five ongoing authorized rural water projects. \n\n\t\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nThe Rural Water Supply Program was authorized by the Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-451 , Title I; 120 Stat. 3345; 43 U.S.C. 2401 note). This programmatic authority expired at the end of FY2016 and has yet to be renewed. Construction and operations and maintenance is ongoing for several geographically specific projects that were previously authorized under various individual acts.\n\n\t\t\tTitle XVI Projects\n\nTitle XVI of P.L. 102-575 directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a program to \"investigate and identify\" opportunities to reclaim and reuse wastewater and naturally impaired ground and surface water. Generally speaking, water reclaimed via Title XVI projects may be used for M&I water supply (nonpotable and indirect potable purposes only), irrigation supply, groundwater recharge, fish and wildlife enhancement, or outdoor recreation.\nThe original Title XVI legislation authorized construction of five reclamation wastewater projects and six wastewater and groundwater recycling/reclamation studies. The act was amended in 1996 ( P.L. 104-266 ) to authorize another 18 construction projects and an additional study, and has been amended several times since, resulting in a total of 53 projects individually authorized for construction. Most recently, amendments to Title XVI enacted in December 2016 in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act, P.L. 114-322 ) made changes to the program, including authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to accept and review nonfederal feasibility studies for potential planning, design, and construction projects. As of February 2019, 47 projects had been authorized under the WIIN Act authority. The WIIN Act also authorized a competitive grant program for construction of projects approved under this authority, including an authorization of $50 million in appropriations. Based on agency data, CRS estimates that as of early 2018, the backlog of remaining federal funding for the 94 authorized Title XVI projects (i.e., both \"traditional\" and WIIN Act authorized projects) was over $1 billion. \n\n\t\t\t\tProject Purposes\n\nThe general purpose of Title XVI projects is to provide supplemental water supplies by recycling/reusing agricultural drainage water, wastewater, brackish surface and groundwater, and other sources of contaminated water. Projects may be permanent or for demonstration purposes.\n\n\t\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nTitle XVI projects are funded through partial de facto grants. The funding is part of the larger Reclamation WaterSMART program, which also provides grants for water conservation and river basin studies under separate authority granted in the Secure Water Act ( P.L. 111-11 , subtitle B). Title XVI project construction costs are shared by the federal government and a local project sponsor or sponsors. The federal share is generally limited to a maximum of 25% of total project costs and is nonreimbursable, resulting in a de facto grant to the local project sponsor(s). In 1996, Congress limited the federal share of individual projects to $20 million in 1996 dollars ( P.L. 104-266 ). The federal share of feasibility studies is limited to 50% of the total, except in cases of \"financial hardship\"; however, the federal share must be reimbursed. The Secretary may also accept in-kind services that are determined to positively contribute to the study.\n\n\t\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nSimilar to other Reclamation activities, the Title XVI water reclamation and wastewater recycling program is limited to projects and studies in the 17 western states unless otherwise specified. Authorized recipients of program assistance include \"legally organized non-federal entities,\" such as irrigation districts, water districts, municipalities, and Indian tribes. Prior to enactment of the WIIN Act, Administration requests for construction funding have generally been limited to projects where (1) an appraisal investigation and feasibility study have been completed and approved by the Secretary; (2) the Secretary determined that the project sponsor was capable of funding the nonfederal share of project costs; and (3) the local sponsor entered into a cost-share agreement with Reclamation. The WIIN Act provided DOI with additional authority to accept nonfederal feasibility studies and approve and consider these projects for construction funding if they meet Title XVI program criteria, including that (1) the study complies with federal laws and regulations applicable to water reuse and recycling studies, and (2) the project is technically and financially feasible and provides a federal benefit in accordance with Reclamation laws. The WIIN Act authority has essentially rendered unnecessary the prior practice of obtaining geographically specific authorizations for individual Title XVI projects before they can pursue funding.\nOver time, Reclamation has issued and revised multiple documents outlining evaluation criteria for prioritizing Title XVI projects. The most recent evaluation criteria for Title XVI projects (for FY2018 funding) was posted for review and comment in March 2018. \n\n\t\t\t\tFunding\n\nThe total regular appropriation for the Title XVI program in FY2019 was $58.6 million, with $20 million of this funding designated as being available for WIIN Act\u2013authorized projects. The Administration's FY2020 request for Title XVI was $3.0 million. \nProjects authorized prior to 1996 ranged in size from $152 million ($38 million for Reclamation's share), to $690 million ($172 million for Reclamation's share). Post-1996 project authorizations have been smaller in size, ranging from $6.6 million ($1.65 million for Reclamation's share) to $319 million ($20 million for Reclamation's share). \n\n\t\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nThe original statutory authority for the reclamation wastewater and reuse program is the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act, Title XVI of P.L. 102-575 , as amended (43 U.S.C. 390h et. seq.). Other statutes that authorized Title XVI projects include the Reclamation Recycling and Water Conservation Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-266 ); the Oregon Public Land Transfer and Protection Act of 1998 ( P.L. 105-321 ); the 1999 Water Resources Development Act ( P.L. 106-53 , Section 595); the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2001 ( P.L. 106-554 , Division B, Section 106); a bill amending the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act ( P.L. 107-344 ); the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2003 ( P.L. 108-7 , Division D, Section 211); the Emergency Wartime Supplementals Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-11 ); the Irvine Basin Surface and Groundwater Improvement Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-233 ); a bill amending the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act ( P.L. 108-316 ); the Hawaii Water Resources Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-70 ); the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-161 ); the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2009 ( P.L. 110-229 ); the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-11 ; Title IX, Subtitle B); and the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nations Act ( P.L. 114-322 , Title III, Subtitle J). \n[This section was prepared by Charles V.

USACE civil works activities are concentrated on three principal missions\u2014navigation, flood damage reduction, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. Many USACE activities also support municipal and industrial (M&I) water supply, environmental infrastructure, hydroelectric generation, fish and wildlife, and recreation. \n\n\t\t\tMunicipal and Industrial (M&I) Water Supply\n\nA total of 136 USACE reservoirs have roughly 9.8 million acre-feet of storage designated for M&I water. Most of this water was allocated to M&I purposes when the projects were constructed; around 0.9 million acre-feet of this storage space has been allocated to M&I use from existing USACE reservoirs using USACE's general water supply authorities. The provision of M&I water from USACE reservoirs, as discussed below, is subject to availability, and the associated costs are 100% a local, nonfederal responsibility. \nAdditionally Congress has chosen to authorize a small number of USACE projects primarily for water supply. In the WIIN Act, Congress expanded the agency's authorities related to \"water conservation\" at its projects. USACE also has authorities related to water supply provision as part of emergency and disaster relief, including during droughts. For all of its projects, USACE policy is that it does not acquire water rights for these water supply and conservation uses; the water user is responsible for securing water rights. Congress has given USACE limited general authority for M&I water supply. A 1958 authority is for permanent allocation of water storage for M&I applications, and a 1944 authority provides for temporary contracts for surplus water from USACE reservoirs. The Water Supply Act of 1958 authorized USACE (and Reclamation) to recommend economically justified M&I water supply storage space in new or existing reservoirs. USACE also has authority for the short-term provision of surplus water as specified in the Flood Control Act of 1944; surplus water contracts have generally been limited to five-year terms, with options to extend.\n\n\t\t\t\tProject Purposes\n\nAs previously noted, Congress authorized USACE to allocate a portion of its multipurpose reservoirs for permanent M&I storage, or to provide M&I water from USACE reservoirs under temporary contacts for surplus water. Neither authority allows USACE to significantly modify its projects or to seriously affect the authorized purposes for which the project operates in order to provide for M&I water supply, nor allows USACE to sell or allocate quantities of water. Instead, USACE M&I contracts are for space in a reservoir and provide no guarantee of a fixed quantity of water to be delivered in a given year. Under these authorities, USACE delivers water if it is available in the storage space and if delivery does not seriously affect other authorized purposes.\n\n\t\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nNo federal money is provided to nonfederal entities through USACE for this work; instead, it is nonfederal entities that pay USACE for M&I water storage. USACE construction projects are financed up front by the federal government, and costs for M&I project purposes are repaid 100%, with interest, via long-term (typically 30-50 years) repayment contracts, unless specified otherwise in law. Through annual contract payments, nonfederal entities pay for the M&I water supply storage services provided. Most agreements for new M&I water supply storage are associated with existing USACE reservoirs and are managed through agreements requiring annual payments. \n\n\t\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nFor new USACE projects with M&I water supply, existing law and agency policy require that (1) water supply benefits and costs be equitably allocated among multiple purposes; (2) repayment by state or local interests be agreed to before construction; (3) the water supply allocation for anticipated demand at any project not exceed 30% of the total estimated cost; (4) repayment shall be either during construction (without interest), or over 30 years (with adjustable interest rates); and (5) users reimburse USACE annually for all operation and maintenance or replacement costs. Occasional exceptions to USACE's general authority have been enacted by Congress. Allocation of water supply at existing projects is limited to actions that do not seriously affect project purposes.\n\n\t\t\t\tFunding\n\nThe fees collected from nonfederal entities pursuant to water supply agreements are deposited into a general account at the U.S. Treasury. The agency uses the federal funds primarily for administration of its water supply authorities. From FY2018 appropriations, USACE used $8 million to implement its water supply authorities and $1 million for two authorized USACE water supply construction projects to address groundwater depletion in Arkansas. From FY2019 annual appropriations, USACE planned to use $7 million for its water supply authorities, $3 million for the ground water depletion projects in Arkansas, and $2 million a water supply reservoir reallocation study as part of an expansion of a USACE reservoir in Colorado. The Administration's FY2020 budget request included $7 million for USACE's water supply storage activities. \n\n\t\t\t\tStatutory Authority\n\nWater Supply Act of 1958 (Title III, 72 Stat. 320, as amended; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7390b); Flood Control Act of 1944 (Section 6, 58 Stat. 890, as amended, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7708); and project specific authorities in Water Resources Development Acts or similar legislation.\n\n\t\t\tEnvironmental Infrastructure Assistance\n\n\t\t\t\tProject Purpose\n\nFederal policy generally is that community water supply is a local and state responsibility. However, communities, particularly rural and small communities, increasingly have sought federal water supply assistance. Since 1992, Congress has enacted more than 400 authorizations allowing USACE to provide designated communities, counties, and states with design and construction assistance for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure (including treatment, and distribution/collection facilities) and source water protection and development; these activities are known as environmental infrastructure projects. The authorizations of federal appropriations for these activities vary widely from $0.5 million to $25 million for planning and design assistance, to $0.2 million to $435 million for construction assistance. As with Reclamation's rural water supply and Title XVI projects, congressional funding of these authorizations has enlarged the scope of the agency's activities. Like many USACE activities, congressional support for specific environmental infrastructure assistance authorizations and appropriations is complicated by the authorities' geographic specificity, which is problematic under congressional earmark bans and moratoria.\n\n\t\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nUnder most USACE environmental infrastructure assistance authorizations, federal assistance typically requires a 75% federal and 25% nonfederal cost-share. The federal portion typically is provided by Congress to USACE in annual Energy and Water Development Act appropriations legislation. How USACE and nonfederal financing is managed varies according to the specifics of the authorization. Sometimes USACE is responsible for performing the assistance or for contracting out the work; under other authorizations, USACE uses appropriated funds to financially assist by reimbursing nonfederal sponsors for their work.\n\n\t\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nBecause environmental infrastructure assistance activities are not part of a national USACE program per se, there are no clear and/or consistent general eligibility criteria. Most of USACE environmental infrastructure authorities specify a specific geographic location (e.g., a city, county, or state) and types of projects (e.g., municipal drinking water) as the principal eligibility requirements. Consequently, an activity's eligibility is evaluated by identifying whether there is an authorization for the geographic area of the activity, and whether the type of activity is eligible under that authorization. Because this assistance is not associated with a traditional USACE water resources projects, it is not subject to USACE planning requirements (e.g., a benefit-cost analysis is not performed). \n\n\t\t\t\tFunding\n\nOnly a subset of authorized USACE environmental infrastructure activities has received appropriations. Since 1992, Congress has provided USACE roughly $2 billion in funds for environmental infrastructure assistance. Congress provided USACE with $70 million for environmental infrastructure assistance activities in FY2018 and $77 million in FY2019. These funds are part of the \"additional funding\" provided by Congress in enacted appropriations bills. After enactment of an appropriations bill, the Administration follows guidance provided in the bill and accompanying reports to guide its use of these funds on authorized environmental infrastructure assistance activities. The selected environmental infrastructure assistance activities are identified in the agency's Work Plan for the fiscal year, which is typically available within two months after enactment of appropriations. Recent funds have been used to continue ongoing environmental infrastructure assistance. Interpretation of limitations on initiating new USACE activities in appropriations bills and accompanying reports appear to be limiting initiation of USACE funding for the environmental infrastructure activities that do not have a broad geographic scope.\nThe Trump Administration requested no funding for these activities in its FY2020 request. Since the first authorization for environmental infrastructure assistance in 1992, no administration has asked for funding for USACE environmental infrastructure assistance.\n\n\t\t\t\tStatutory Authority\n\nPrior to 1992, USACE generally was not widely involved with municipal drinking water treatment and distribution and wastewater collection and treatment; the agency is now authorized to contribute to more than 400 environmental infrastructure projects and programs. A Water Resources Development Act or similar legislation is the typical legislative vehicle for USACE authorizations. Beginning with Sections 219 and 313 of WRDA 1992 ( P.L. 102-580 ), Congress has authorized USACE to assist local interests with planning, design, and construction assistance for environmental infrastructure projects. Subsequent USACE authorization bills included new environmental infrastructure assistance activities, and raised the authorized funding ceilings for previously authorized projects. Policies limiting congressionally directed spending have limited recent congressional authorizing activity of environmental infrastructure assistance. In December 2016, Congress expanded a process for nonfederal entities to propose modifications to existing authorities for environmental infrastructure assistance. For those proposals that meet the criteria established by Congress, the Administration transmits those proposals to Congress for its consideration as part of deliberations regarding USACE authorization legislation.\n[This section was prepared by Anna E. Normand, Analyst in Natural Resources Policy, Resources, Science and Industry Division.]\n\n\tDepartment of Agriculture\n\n\t\tRural Utilities Service (Water and Waste Disposal Programs)\n\nThe USDA has a variety of water and waste disposal programs to provide loans and grants for drinking water, sanitary sewer, and storm drainage facilities in rural communities. Eligibility is limited to rural communities of 10,000 population or less. These programs are administered at the national level by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) at USDA. RUS allocates program funds to the USDA State Rural Development Offices through an allocation formula based on rural population, poverty, and unemployment. Loans originate at the USDA's State Rural Development offices. \nBetween 2009 and 2016, RUS had funded $13.9 billion for nearly 5,825 projects for water supply and wastewater facilities. According to an RUS FY2016 annual report, 46% of $1.8 billion in investments in that year were for water supply, 49% were for wastewater systems, and the remaining 5% were for combined projects. There is heavy demand for water supply and wastewater disposal funds for small rural communities. At the end of FY2016, USDA reported a $2.5 billion backlog of requests for water and wastewater projects. \n\n\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nThe purpose of these programs is to provide basic human amenities, alleviate health hazards, and promote the orderly growth of the nation's rural areas by meeting the need for new and improved rural water and waste disposal facilities. Eligible projects can include drinking water facilities, sanitary sewers, and stormwater drainage and disposal facilities. Funds may be used for installation, repair, improvement, or expansion of rural water facilities, including costs of distribution lines and well-pumping facilities. The law directs that USDA make grants of 1% to 3% of total grant funding to qualified nonprofits to provide technical assistance and training to help communities in preparing applications for grants and loans and to help problem solving operation and maintenance of existing water and waste disposal facilities in rural areas. This has totaled $18 million to $20 million annually in recent years. For FY2018, technical assistance for water and waste disposal facilities will increase to $40 million. \n\n\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nDirect loans, guaranteed loans, and grants provide USDA support for water and waste disposal projects. USDA prefers making direct loans. Grants are made only when necessary to reduce average annual user charges to a reasonable level, particularly for lower-income communities. The split between loans and grants distributed from the regular infrastructure program, which is the large majority of spending, was about 75-25 in 2015 and 2016. There is no statutory distribution formula. Funds are allocated to states based upon rural population, number of households in poverty, and unemployment. There are no matching requirements for states.\nWater and Waste Disposal Loans. The Rural Development Act of 1972 authorized establishment of the Rural Development Insurance Fund under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. Among other activities, this fund is used for loans (direct and guaranteed) to develop storage, treatment, purification, or distribution of water or collection, treatment, or disposal of waste in low-income rural areas. Loans are repayable in not more than 40 years or the useful life of the facilities, whichever is less. USDA makes either direct loans to applicants or guarantees up to 90% of loans made by third-party lenders such as banks and savings and loan associations.\nLoan interest rates are based on the community's economic and health environment and are designated poverty, market, or intermediate. Poverty interest rate loans are made in areas where the median household income (MHI) falls below the higher of 80% of the statewide nonurban MHI, or the poverty level, and the project is needed to meet health or sanitary standards; by law, this rate is set at 60% of the market rate. The market rate is adjusted quarterly and is set using the average of a specified 11-bond index. It applies to loans to applicants where the MHI of the service area exceeds the statewide nonurban MHI. The intermediate rate applies to loans that do not meet the criteria for the poverty rate and which do not have to pay the market rate; by law, this rate is set at 80% of the market rate. Interest rates on guaranteed loans are negotiated between the borrower and the lender. The 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) amended the water and waste disposal direct and guaranteed loan programs to encourage financing by private or cooperative lenders to the maximum extent possible, use of loan guarantees where the population exceeds 5,500, and use of direct loans where the impact of a guaranteed loan on rate payers would be significant.\nWater and Waste Disposal Grants . Grants for the development costs of water supply and waste disposal projects in rural areas also are authorized under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. Only communities with poverty and intermediate rate incomes qualify for USDA grants. An eligible project must serve a rural area that is not likely to decline in population below the level for which the project was designed and constructed so that adequate capacity will or can be made available to serve the reasonably foreseeable growth needs of the area. The 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) authorized appropriations at $30 million annually through FY2018 for these grants. The appropriation for water and waste water grants is $400 million. \nGrant funds may be available for up to 75% of the development cost of a project and should only be used to reduce user costs to a reasonable level. Grants are only made after a determination of the maximum amount of loan that a community can afford and still have reasonable user rates. Grants, which typically provide 35%-45% of project costs, may be used to supplement other funds borrowed or furnished by applicants for project costs, and may be combined with USDA loans when the applicant is able to repay part, but not all, of the project costs. Priority is given to projects serving populations of less than 5,500.\nEmergency Community Water Assistance Grants . RUS is also authorized to help eligible communities prepare, or recover from, an emergency that threatens the availability of safe, reliable drinking water. Grants, ranging from $10,000 to a maximum of $500,000, are provided for projects to serve a rural area with a population of 10,000 or less that has a median household income not in excess of the statewide nonmetropolitan median household income. Grants for repairs, partial replacement, or significant maintenance of an established system cannot exceed $150,000. Communities use the funds for new systems, waterline extensions, construction of water source and treatment facilities, and repairs or renovation of existing systems and may be awarded for 100% of project cost. Applicants compete on a national basis for available funding. Funding for this program is mandatory through reservation of 3% to 5% of appropriated water and waste disposal grant funds. Of the amounts appropriated for water and waste disposal grants, 3% to 5% is reserved for grants for the Emergency and Imminent Water Assistance program. The 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) also authorized an additional $35 million per year through FY2018 for this program. Amounts provided through this program have been quite variable over time, depending on need. In FY2014, $14.7 million was distributed in 14 states; in FY2015, $2.5 million was distributed in 14 states. No funds were appropriated for the program in FY2017 and FY2018.\n\n\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nEligible entities are municipalities, counties, and other political subdivisions of a state; associations, cooperatives, and organizations operated on a not-for-profit basis; Indian tribes on federal and state reservations; and other federally recognized tribes. USDA's loan and grant programs are limited to community service areas (including areas in cities or towns) with population of 10,000 or less. To be eligible for assistance, communities must be unable to get reasonable credit through normal commercial channels. Also, communities must be below certain income levels. Loans and grants are made for projects needed to meet health or sanitary standards, including Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act standards and requirements. The 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) authorized $5 million per year through FY2018 for USDA to make grants to private nonprofit organizations for the purpose of providing loans to eligible individuals for construction, refurbishing, and servicing of individually owned household water well systems. Loans are limited to $11,000 per water well system. Authorized appropriations for the program were $993,000 in both FY2017 and FY2018. \n\n\t\t\tFunding\n\nFunds available through FY2018 appropriations for USDA's water and waste disposal programs were included in two titles of P.L. 115-141 . Title III provided $560.3 million in total for FY2018, including $400.0 million in grants, $2.0 million in direct loan subsidies ($1.2 billion in loan authority), and $230,000 in subsidy to support guaranteed loans ($50.0 million in loan authority). Title VII (Section 780) provided an additional $500 million for the grant and loan program \"of which not to exceed $495,000,000 shall be for grants.\" Out of the total FY2018 funds, USDA has appropriations of $1.0 million for grants to capitalize revolving loans for water and waste disposal systems and $68 million to support water and waste disposal projects in the colonias, Alaskan Native communities, and Hawaiian Native communities. For FY2019, the President's budget requested $1.20 billion in direct loan authority and $0 for guaranteed loans and water and waste disposal grants.\n\n\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nStatutory authority for the water and waste disposal loan and grant programs is the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, as amended, Section 306, 7 U.S.C. 1926. Regulations for these programs are codified at 7 C.F.R. Parts 1778-1780. \n[This section was prepared by Tadlock Cowan, Analyst in Natural Resources and Rural Development Policy, Resources, Science and Industry Division.]\n\n\t\tNatural Resources Conservation Service\n\nThe USDA provides assistance to watershed activities under four closely related authorities that are administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program (WFPO) consists of two authorities\u2014referred to as P.L. 566 and P.L. 534 projects. These authorize NRCS to provide technical and financial assistance to state and local organizations to plan and install measures to prevent erosion, sedimentation, and flood damage and to conserve, develop, and utilize land and water resources. Dams constructed under the WFPO program are eligible to receive assistance under the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program, authorized by Congress in 2000. The fourth watershed authority is an emergency program that is not discussed in this report.\n\n\t\t\tWatershed and Flood Prevention Operations\n\nThe WFPO program consists of projects built under two authorities\u2014the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954 (P.L. 83-566) and the Flood Control Act of 1944 (P.L. 78-534). The vast majority of the projects have been built pursuant to the authority of P.L. 83-566 (referred to as P.L. 566 projects), under which smaller projects (discussed below) authorized by the Chief of the NRCS are constructed. Larger projects must be approved by Congress. Eleven projects were specifically authorized under P.L. 78-534 (referred to as P.L. 534 projects); they are much larger and more expensive than P.L. 566 projects.\nUnder P.L. 566, over 2,100 projects have been authorized through FY2018. In FY2018, NRCS funded 23 new projects, 19 existing projects, and five remedial projects.\nThe 11 projects that were specifically authorized under P.L. 534 encompass a total of almost 37.9 million acres and are divided into component projects in subwatersheds. Approximately 90% of the work on the P.L. 534 projects is complete. With the exception of the two smallest projects, the estimated federal costs for each of these projects range from $40 million to more than $275 million. Three of the projects have been completed, and work on the remainder continues in one or more subwatersheds.\nThe FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 116-6 , FY2019 appropriations) appropriated $150 million in FY2019. Recent amendments in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 farm bill, P.L. 115-334 ) permanently authorized an additional $50 million annually from mandatory sources to the WFPO program.\n\n\t\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the program is to provide technical and financial assistance to states and local organizations to plan and install watershed projects. Both P.L. 566 and P.L. 534 have similar objectives and are implemented following similar procedures. Both programs fund land treatment, and nonstructural and structural facilities for flood prevention, erosion reduction, agricultural water management, public recreation development, fish and wildlife habitat development, and municipal or industrial water supplies. Structural measures can include dams, levees, canals, and pumping stations. Local sponsors agree to operate and maintain completed projects.\n\n\t\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nPartial project grants, plus provision of technical advisory services are provided. Financing for water projects under the WFPO program varies depending on project purposes. The federal government pays all costs related to construction for flood control purposes only. Costs for nonagricultural water supply must be repaid by local organizations; however, up to 50% of costs for land, easements, and rights-of-way allocated to public fish and wildlife and recreational developments may be paid with program funds. Additionally, sponsors may apply for USDA Rural Utilities Service (RUS) Water and Waste Program loans to finance the local share of project costs. Participating state and local organizations pay all operation and maintenance costs.\n\n\t\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nP.L. 566 has been called the small watershed program because no project may exceed 250,000 acres, and no structure may exceed more than 12,500 acre-feet of floodwater detention capacity, or 25,000 acre-feet of total capacity. The Senate and House Agriculture Committees must approve projects that need an estimated federal contribution of more than $25 million for construction or include a storage structure with a capacity in excess of 2,500 acre feet. If the storage structure will have a capacity in excess of 4,000 acre feet, approval is also required from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. There are no population or community income-level limits on applications for P.L. 566 projects, but at least 20% of the total benefits of the project must directly relate to agriculture (including rural communities).\n\n\t\t\t\tFunding\n\nThe enacted FY2019 appropriation provided WFPO with $150 million. Of the $150 million, $50 million is required to be allocated to projects and activities that can \"commence promptly;\" address regional priorities for flood prevention, agricultural water management, inefficient irrigation systems, fish and wildlife habitat, or watershed protection; or watershed protection projects authorized under P.L. 534. The FY2020 Administration's request proposes no funding for the program.\nBeginning in FY2014, when no funding was appropriated for WFPO, Congress directed funding from another conservation account\u2014Conservation Operations, which funds general conservation technical assistance offered by NRCS\u2014to fund projects authorized under the WFPO authority. The use of Conservation Operation funding for WFPO activities has continued each fiscal year through the FY2019 appropriations. This congressionally directed amount is in addition to the $150 million made available for the program as a whole in FY2019.\nIn addition to discretionary funding provided through appropriations, the 2018 farm bill permanently authorized $50 million annually from mandatory sources. This mandatory funding will be available unless otherwise amended by Congress. Mandatory funds are authorized for P.L. 566 projects as well as rehabilitation work under the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program. \n\n\t\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authorities\n\nThe Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO) program consists of two authorities: the Flood Control Act of 1944, P.L. 78-534, as amended, 58 Stat. 905 (33 U.S.C. 701b-1); and the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954, P.L. 83-566, as amended, 68 Stat. 666 (16 U.S.C. 1001-1008). Regulations are codified at 7 C.F.R. Part 622. \n\n\t\t\tSmall Watershed Loans\n\nAs part of its lending responsibilities, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) at USDA (see discussion above) makes loans to local organizations to finance the local share of the cost of installing, repairing, or improving facilities, purchasing sites and easements, and related costs for P.L. 566 and P.L. 534 projects. Loans are limited to $10 million; they must be repaid within 50 years; and the cost-share assistance may not exceed the rate of assistance for similar projects under other USDA conservation programs. NRCS and the local organization must also agree on a plan of work before a loan is obligated. Over the life of the program, 495 RUS loans have been made at a value of almost $176 million.\n\n\t\t\tSmall Watershed Rehabilitation\n\nSome of the oldest P.L. 566 projects that have exceeded their design life (dams were constructed starting in 1948) need rehabilitation work to continue to protect public health and safety by reducing any possibility of dam failure, and to meet changing resource needs. By December 2018, approximately 6,245 watershed dams have reached the end of their originally designed life spans. By the end of 2019, more than half of the 11,847 watershed dams will have reached the end of their designed life spans. In response to this concern, Congress created a rehabilitation program, known as the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program, in Section 313 of the Grain Standards and Warehouse Improvement Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-472 ), which revised the WFPO program. From 2000 to 2018, the program authorized the rehabilitation of 288 dams in 31 states. Of this total, 150 projects are complete, and the remaining projects are waiting for funding.\n\n\t\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nThe purpose of rehabilitation is to extend the service life of the dams and bring them into compliance with applicable safety and performance standards or to decommission the dams so they no longer pose a threat to life and property.\n\n\t\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nPartial project grants, plus provision of technical advisory services are provided. NRCS may provide 65% of the total rehabilitation costs but no more than 100% of the actual construction cost, and is prohibited from funding operation and maintenance expense. Rehabilitation projects also provide an opportunity to modify projects to provide additional benefits, including municipal water supplies. Local watershed project sponsors provide 35% of the cost of a rehabilitation project and obtain needed land rights and permits. The source of these funds varies from state to state and may include bonds, local taxing authority, state appropriations, or in-kind technical services. \n\n\t\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nOnly dams constructed under the P.L. 566 authority, the Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) program, and pilot watershed projects authorized in the Agriculture Appropriations Act of 1953 are eligible for assistance under the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program.\n\n\t\t\t\tFunding\n\nSince FY2000, Congress has appropriated more than $700 million for rehabilitation projects. The Trump Administration is seeking no funding for the Small Watershed Rehabilitation program for FY2020, citing the Administration's position that the maintenance, repair, and operation of these dams are the responsibility of local project sponsors. Similar positions were cited under the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations.\nThe Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program has discretionary funding authority of up to $85 million annually. The program has received an average annual appropriation of $11.2 million over the last five years, including $10 million in FY2019.\nIn the past, the program was authorized through omnibus farm bills to receive mandatory funding to remain available until expended. This funding was frequently restricted through annual appropriations to generate annual savings. The FY2018 appropriations act was the first to not restrict the remaining mandatory carryover, thereby making approximately $55 million available for obligation. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized discretionary funding authority for the program, but no additional mandatory funding authority was provided.\n\n\t\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authorities\n\nThe Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program is authorized by the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954, P.L. 83-566, as amended by \u00a7313 of the Grain Standards and Warehouse Improvement Act of 2000, P.L. 106-472 , 114 Stat. 2077 (16 U.S.C. 1012). Regulations are codified at 7 C.F.R. Part 622. \n[This section was prepared by Megan Stubbs, Specialist in Agricultural Conservation and Natural Resources Policy, Resources, Science and Industry Division.]\n\n\tEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\n\t\tClean Water State Revolving Fund Loan Program\n\nThe Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes performance levels (e.g., secondary treatment) to be attained by municipal sewage treatment plants in order to prevent the discharge of harmful wastes into surface waters. The act also provides financial assistance, so that communities can construct treatment facilities in compliance with the law, which has the overall objective of restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters.\nSince 1973, Congress has appropriated approximately $98 billion in program grants that support wastewater projects. Funds are distributed to states under a statutory allocation formula and are used to assist qualified projects on priority lists that are determined by individual states. These funds are used to assist localities in meeting wastewater infrastructure needs most recently estimated (in 2016) by EPA and states at $271 billion nationally (over the next 20 years) for all categories of projects eligible for federal assistance under the law.\nIn 1987, Congress amended the CWA ( P.L. 100-4 ) and initiated a new program of federal capitalization grants to support Clean Water State Revolving Funds (CWSRFs). Prior to 1989 (when the CWSRF program became effective), states used their annual allocations to make grants to cities and other eligible recipients. Since 1989, federal funds (grants of appropriated funds) have been used to capitalize state loan programs with states providing matching funds equal to 20% of the federal funds to capitalize the CWSRF. All 50 states, plus Puerto Rico, participate in the CWSRF program. Over the long term, the loan programs are intended to be sustained through repayment of loans to states, thus creating a continuing source of assistance for other communities. \nEPA data indicate that since 1987, 67% of all loans and other assistance have gone to assist communities with 10,000 people or fewer. These loans and assistance have comprised 22% of total CWSRF funding.\n\n\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nThe CWSRF program provides assistance in constructing and upgrading publicly owned municipal wastewater treatment plants, implementing nonpoint pollution management programs, developing and implementing management plans under the National Estuary Program, and supporting other eligible activities.\n\n\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nEPA grants (from appropriated funds) and state matching funds help capitalize state CWSRF programs. These programs may provide seven general types of financial assistance: making loans; buying or refinancing existing local debt obligations; guaranteeing or purchasing insurance for local debt obligations; guaranteeing CWSRF debt obligations (i.e., to be used as security for leveraging the assets in the CWSRF); providing loan guarantees for local government revolving funds; earning interest on fund accounts; and supporting reasonable costs of administering the CWSRF. Loans are made at or below market interest rates, including zero interest loans, as determined by the state in negotiation with the applicant. \nAlthough the CWSRF program is generally a loan program, states may (under certain conditions) provide \"additional subsidization\"\u2014such as principal forgiveness, negative interest loans, or a combination\u2014to municipalities that meet the state's affordability criteria and for particular projects, such as those that implement water or energy efficiency goals or mitigate stormwater runoff. In addition, appropriations acts in recent years have required states to use minimum percentages of their allotted funds to provide additional subsidization. This trend began with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ), which required states to use at least 50% of their funds for this purpose. Recent appropriations acts included an identical condition, requiring 10% of the CWSRF grants be used \"to provide additional subsidy to eligible recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants (or any combination of these).\"\nAll principal and interest payments on loans must be credited directly to the SRF, and loans are to be repaid within 30 years of a project's completion, not to exceed the project's useful life. States are required to ensure that CWSRF-funded projects use American iron and steel products and apply the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act.\n\n\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nEligible loan recipients for CWSRF assistance are any municipality, intermunicipal, interstate, or state agency. Private utilities are not eligible to receive funds for construction of wastewater treatment works and most other eligible activities, but in some cases, privately owned projects are eligible for certain types of activities (e.g., decentralized wastewater treatment projects; projects to manage, reduce or treat stormwater; or development of watershed management projects).\nProjects or activities eligible for funding were, initially, those needed for constructing or upgrading (and planning and designing) publicly owned municipal wastewater treatment plans. As defined in Clean Water Act Section 212, devices and systems used in the storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of municipal sewage are eligible. These include construction or upgrading of secondary or advanced treatment plants; construction of new collector sewers, interceptor sewers, or storm sewers; and projects to correct existing problems of sewer system rehabilitation, infiltration/inflow of sewer lines, and combined sewer overflows. Operation and maintenance are not eligible activities. All funds in the clean water SRF resulting from federal capitalization grants are first to be used to assure compliance with enforceable deadlines, goals, and requirements of the act, including municipal compliance. After satisfying the \"first use\" requirement, funds may be used to implement other eligible uses, which initially included nonpoint source management programs and estuary activities in approved State Nonpoint Management Programs and estuarine Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans, respectively. \nIn 2000, Congress authorized separate CWA grant funding for projects to address overflows from municipal combined sewer systems and from municipal separate sanitary sewers (\"wet weather\" projects). Overflows from these portions of municipal sewerage systems can occur especially during rainfall or other wet weather events and can result in discharges of untreated sewage into local waterways. This program, contained in the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 106-554 , Division B, Section 112), authorized $750 million per year in FY2002 and FY2003. No funds were appropriated for this program. America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA, P.L. 115-270 ), enacted on October 23, 2018, reauthorized appropriations for the grant program (and expanded it to include certain stormwater activities) for $225 million for FY2019 and FY2020. The FY2019 appropriations act did not provide funding for this program.\nIn 2014, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA; P.L. 113-121 ) amended the list of eligible projects by adding several projects and activities, including\nreplacement of decentralized treatment systems (e.g., septic tanks), energy-efficiency improvements at treatment works, reuse and recycling of wastewater or stormwater, and security improvements at treatment works.\nIn 2018, AWIA amended the list of eligible activities to allow qualified nonprofits to provide assistance to certain individuals for the repair or replacement of existing decentralized wastewater treatment systems or for the connection of an individual household to a centralized publicly owned treatment works.\n\n\t\t\tFunding\n\nSince the first appropriations for the clean water SRF program in FY1989, Congress has provided more than $46 billion in grants to states and Puerto Rico to capitalize their CWSRFs. Through March 2018, federal funds, together with state matching contributions, repaid loans, and other funds, have been used for $126 billion in SRF assistance to support more than 39,000 SRF loans and debt refinance agreements. \nIn both FY2016 and FY2017, Congress provided $1.394 billion for the CWSRF program. In FY2018, Congress increased the appropriation to the CWSRF program, providing $1.694 billion ( P.L. 115-141 ). In FY2019, Congress maintained the same level as the previous fiscal year, $1.694 billion ( P.L. 116-6 ). For FY2020, the President requested $1.120 billion for the CWSRF program.\nThrough a separate process, EPA provides direct grants for the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of Northern Marianas. EPA also provides direct grants to Indian tribes (33 U.S.C. \u00a71377). The funding for the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Indian tribes is part of the SRF appropriation to EPA.\n\n\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nStatutory authority for the clean water SRF program is the Clean Water Act, as amended, Sections 601-607, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71381-1387. Regulations are codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a735.3100.\n[This section was prepared by Jonathan Ramseur, Specialist in Resources and Environmental Policy, Resources, Science and Industry Division.]\n\n\t\tDrinking Water State Revolving Fund Loan Program\n\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requires public water systems to comply with federal drinking water regulations promulgated by EPA. Through these regulations, EPA has set standards to control the levels of approximately 90 contaminants in drinking water, and more regulations are under development. To help communities meet these federal mandates and to meet the act's public health objectives, Congress amended the SDWA in 1996 to establish a drinking water state revolving fund (DWSRF) loan program. The program is patterned closely after the clean water SRF, and authorizes EPA to make grants to states to capitalize drinking water state revolving loan funds. States use their DWSRFs to provide assistance to public water systems for infrastructure and other drinking water projects. States must match 20% of the federal capitalization grant. \nEach year, states must develop an \"intended use plan\" that includes a list of projects the state intends to fund through the DWSRF (referred to as the project priority list). The law generally directs states to give funding priority to projects that (1) address the most serious health risks; (2) are needed to ensure compliance with SDWA regulations; and (3) assist systems most in need on a per household basis, according to state affordability criteria. The law also directs states to make available at least 15% of their annual allotment to public water systems that serve 10,000 or fewer persons (to the extent the funds can be obligated to eligible projects). Over the life of the program, roughly 71% of DWSRF assistance agreements and 38% of funds have gone to these smaller systems. Capitalization grants are allotted among the states according to the results of the most recent quadrennial survey of the capital improvements needs of eligible water systems. Needs surveys are prepared by EPA and the states, and the most recent survey indicates that public water systems need to invest at least $$472.6 billion on infrastructure improvements over 20 years ($23.63 billion annually) to ensure the provision of safe drinking water and compliance with federal standards. \n\n\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nThis state-administered program provides assistance for infrastructure projects and other expenditures that facilitate compliance with federal drinking water regulations or that promote public health protection. The SDWA directs states to give funding priority to infrastructure projects that are needed to achieve or maintain compliance with SDWA requirements, protect public health, and assist systems with economic need. Further, states may use a portion of the capitalization grant for specified purposes, including programs for protecting sources of drinking water and improving the managerial and technical capacity of water systems. \n\n\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nStates may use the DWSRF to make low- or zero-interest loans to public water systems, and loan recipients generally must repay the entire loan plus any interest to the state. DWSRFs may also be used to buy or refinance local debt obligations, to guarantee or purchase insurance for a local obligation, as a source of revenue or security for payment of principal and interest on state revenue or general obligation bonds if the proceeds of the sale of the bonds are deposited into the DWSRF, and to earn interest on DWSRF accounts. \nThe statute authorizes states to use up to 35% of their annual DWSRF grants to provide additional subsidies (e.g., principal forgiveness and negative interest rate loans) to help economically disadvantaged communities of any size. (A disadvantaged community is one in which the service area of a public water system meets state-established affordability criteria.) As with recent appropriations acts, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) requires states to use 20% of their DWSRF capitalization grants \"to provide additional subsidy to eligible recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants (or any combination of these).\"\n\n\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nDrinking water systems that are eligible to receive DWSRF assistance include community water systems, whether publicly or privately owned, and not-for-profit noncommunity water systems. Federally owned systems are not eligible to receive assistance from this program.\nProjects eligible for DWSRF assistance include (1) capital investments to rehabilitate or replace infrastructure in order to continue providing the public with safe drinking water (e.g., storage facilities, and transmission and distribution pipes); (2) projects needed to address violations of SDWA regulations (e.g., treatment facilities); and (3) project design and planning and associated preconstruction activities. Assistance may also be available for construction of new wells to replace contaminated wells, source water protection, land acquisition, security measures (including infrastructure improvements), and consolidation of water supplies (e.g., in cases where individual homes or public water systems have a water supply that is contaminated, or a system is unable to maintain compliance for financial or managerial reasons).\nProjects and activities not eligible for funding include projects primarily intended to serve future growth or to provide fire protection, construction of dams or reservoirs (except reservoirs for treated water), monitoring, and operation and maintenance. Ineligible systems include those that lack the financial, technical or managerial capacity to maintain SDWA compliance and systems in significant noncompliance with any SDWA regulation (unless the project is likely to ensure compliance).\n\n\t\t\tFunding\n\nFor FY2018, the President requested $863.2 million for the state DWSRF capitalization grants, and Congress appropriated $1,163.2 million ( P.L. 115-141 ). For FY2019, the President requested $863 million, and Congress provided $1,164.0 million ( P.L. 116-6 ). AWIA reauthorized DWSRF appropriations for FY2019 through FY2021. In recent years, the estimated average state grant has been roughly $17.16 million per fiscal year. The estimated average grant to territories was $3.40 million per fiscal year. \nFrom FY1997 through FY2018, cumulative appropriations for the DWSRF program reached $22.11 billion. Adjusted for set-asides, cumulative net federal contributions totaled $21.52 billion. When combined with the 20% state match ($3.91 billion), bond proceeds, loan principal repayments, and other funds, the total DWSRF investment through FY2018 had reached $39.86 billion, and the program had provided more than $38.22 billion in assistance. Over the same period, more than 14,577 projects had received assistance, and 10,441 had been completed. \n\n\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nThe statutory authority for the DWSRF program is the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 ( P.L. 104-182 , Section 1452, 42 U.S.C. 300j-12). Regulations are codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a735.3500. \n[This section was prepared by Mary Tiemann, Specialist in Environmental Policy, and Elena Humphreys, Analyst in Environmental Policy, Resources, Science, and Industry Division.]\n\n\t\tWater Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Program\n\nLocalities are the entities that are primarily responsible for providing water infrastructure services, which include both drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. According to the most recent estimates by states and EPA, funding needs for projects eligible for CWSRF or DWSRF funding\u2014described in the sections above (i.e., projects needed to address water quality and public health-related problems or regulations)\u2014total $655 billion over a 20-year period. However, many water infrastructure capital needs are ineligible for assistance through the SRF programs or are too large or otherwise not suited for those programs. \nIn 2014, WRRDA established a five-year Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) pilot program. WIFIA authorizes EPA to provide credit assistance\u2014secured (direct) loans or loan guarantees\u2014for a broad range of drinking water and wastewater projects. In contrast to SRF programs, EPA will provide the credit assistance directly to an eligible recipient. Most of the credit assistance will likely be secured loans, as the agency stated that it does not expect much demand for loan guarantees. To be eligible for WIFIA assistance, projects must generally have costs of $20 million or more. \nWRRDA also authorizes the Corps to provide similar assistance under the WIFIA for water resource projects, such as flood control or hurricane and storm damage reduction. Although Congress has provided funds to EPA to implement WIFIA, as of the date of this report, Congress has not yet appropriated funds (nor have any been requested) that would enable the Corps to begin preparations or begin making WIFIA loans under the authority in WRRDA.\n\n\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nWIFIA provides an additional source of funding for water infrastructure projects. Some stakeholders have argued that the clean water and drinking water SRF programs are structured in a way that makes them useful primarily for smaller communities and smaller projects. The WIFIA program can provide credit assistance to large water infrastructure projects that otherwise have difficulty obtaining financing. WIFIA can provide capital at a low cost to the borrower, because even though the interest on 30-year Treasury securities is taxable, Treasury rates can be less expensive than rates on traditional tax-exempt municipal debt.\n\n\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nIn federal budgetary terms, WIFIA assistance has much less of an impact than a grant, which is not repaid to the U.S. Treasury. The volume of loans and other types of credit assistance that the programs can provide is determined by the size of congressional appropriations and calculation of the subsidy amount. WIFIA defines the subsidy amount as follows:\nThe amount of budget authority sufficient to cover the estimated long-term cost to the Federal Government of a Federal credit instrument, as calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental receipts or outlays in accordance with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661 et seq. ).\nAlthough subsidy rates are project-specific, in the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget proposal, OMB estimated a 0.98% subsidy rate for WIFIA. This equates to a 1:102 ratio. At this subsidy rate, a $10 million appropriation could support a direct loan (or loans) totaling $1.02 billion. Thus, one advantage of the WIFIA program is that it can provide a large amount of credit assistance relative to the amount of budget authority provided. \n\n\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nWIFIA credit assistance is available to state infrastructure financing authorities for a group of projects and individual project sponsors, which may include the following:\na corporation; a partnership; a joint venture; a trust; or a federal, state, local, or tribal government (or consortium of tribal governments).\nCategories eligible for assistance by EPA include the following: \nwastewater treatment and community drinking water facilities; enhanced energy efficiency of a public water system or wastewater treatment works; repair or rehabilitation of aging wastewater and drinking water systems; desalination, water recycling, aquifer recharge, or development of alternative water supplies to reduce aquifer depletion; prevention, reduction, or mitigation of the effects of drought; or a combination of eligible projects.\nThe act, among other provisions, authorizes EPA to provide credit assistance for a range of wastewater and drinking water projects. Project costs must be $20 million or larger to be eligible for credit assistance. In rural areas (defined as populations of 25,000 or less), project costs must be $5 million or more.\n\n\t\t\tFunding\n\nFor FY2019, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) provided $68 million for the WIFIA program (including $5 million for administrative costs). To receive funding, a prospective borrower submits a letter of interest to EPA. The letter includes project eligibility, financial creditworthiness, engineering feasibility, and alignment with EPA's policy priorities. From these submittals, the agency selects projects for funding. On March 29, 2019, EPA announced a third round of WIFIA funding. EPA estimated that its budget authority ($63 million) would provide approximately $6 billion in credit assistance.\n\n\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nThe statutory authority for the WIFIA program is WRRDA ( P.L. 113-121 , Title V, codified in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a73901-3914). EPA promulgated an interim final rule for the program on December 19, 2016 (81 F ederal Register 91822). Regulations are codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a735.10000.\n[This section was prepared by Jonathan Ramseur, Specialist in Environmental Policy, Resources, Science and Industry Division.]\n\n\tDepartment of Housing and Urban Development\n\n\t\tCommunity Development Block Grants\n\nHUD administers assistance in support of state and local government neighborhood revitalization and related community and economic development activities, including infrastructure improvements, primarily under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The program's primary objective is to develop viable communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. CDBG funds are used by state and local governments for a broad range of neighborhood revitalization and community and economic development activities intended to meet one of three national objectives. Specifically, eligible activities must\n1. principally benefit low- or moderate-income persons; 2. aid in preventing or eliminating slums and blight; or 3. address an imminent threat to the health and safety of residents. \nProgram policy requires that at least 70% of funds must benefit low- and moderate-income persons. \nThe block nature of the CDBG program provides local government discretion in selecting the eligible activities to be undertaken in pursuit of national objectives. Water and waste disposal needs compete with many other eligible activities for this assistance, including historical preservation, energy conservation, economic development, lead-based paint abatement, public facilities and public service activities. Since it began in 1974, the CDBG program has invested $150 billion in communities nationwide. Congress has also used the program to provide supplemental appropriations to assist communities and states in response to natural disasters, the mortgage foreclosure crisis of 2008, economic recessions, and terrorist attacks. Since 1992, Congress has appropriated approximately $50 billion in supplemental CDBG funding to assist targeted states and local governments in their recovery efforts. Funds from the regular CDBG program have been disbursed across several broad categories, including the acquisition and demolition of real property, planning and administrative activities, housing, public services, and public improvements such as water and wastewater treatment facilities. During the five-year period from FY2012 to FY2016, CDBG expenditures for public improvement\u2014including water and sewer improvements\u2014accounted for approximately 33% of all CDBG funds expended. Water and sewer improvements accounted for 10% of total CDBG expenditures during the same five-year span. \nAfter subtracting amounts specified in appropriations acts for special-purpose activities, 70% of CDBG funds are allocated by formula to approximately 1,224 entitlement communities nationwide. These communities are defined as central cities of metropolitan areas, metropolitan cities with populations of 50,000 or more, and statutorily defined urban counties (the entitlement program). These funds are not available for projects in rural communities. The remaining 30% of CDBG funding is allocated by formula to the states for distribution to nonentitlement communities (the state program) for use in areas that are not part of a CDBG entitlement community allocation. These funds, which are administered by each state, may be available for rural community water projects. The 70/30 split and allocation formulas are provided for in law. Between FY2012 and FY2016, disbursements by CDBG recipients for water and sewer improvements have averaged $370 million per year. \n\n\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nThe primary goal of this program is the development of viable communities by providing decent housing, a suitable living environment, and expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income persons. Funds may also be used to aid in preventing or eliminating slums and blight or to address an imminent threat to residents of the impacted area.\n\n\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nCDBG program funds are allocated by formula. After amounts specified in an appropriations act are allocated to Section 107 special-purpose activities, 70% of the remaining funds are allocated by formula to entitlement communities and 30% to the states for distribution to nonentitlement communities. Funds are awarded to entitlement communities based on the higher yield from one of two weighted formulas. The first of two formulas uses population, overcrowded housing, and poverty data, while the second formula allocates funds based on an entitlement community's relative share of poverty, housing built before 1940, and the lag in population growth rate relative to the total for all entitlement communities. Similar formulas are used to allocate nonentitlement funds to states.\nAs a condition of receiving CDBG funds, an entitlement community must submit a consolidated plan at least 45 days before the beginning of its program year detailing the proposed use of funds over a five-year period. Each entitlement community's multiyear consolidated plan (ConPlan) must include a citizen participation plan, a housing needs assessment, and an annual community development plan. In addition to an annual action plan, each jurisdiction must annually submit to HUD a Comprehensive Annual Performance Evaluation Report (CAPER) detailing progress it has made in meeting the goals and objectives outlined in its action plans.\nStates do not actually undertake eligible CDBG activities but act as pass-through agents charged with three distinct responsibilities: (1) determining the method or methods to be used to distribute funds to nonentitlement communities, including seeking the input of affected local governments; (2) selecting local governments that will receive funds; and (3) monitoring local government grant recipient project implementation to ensure compliance with rules governing the program. In addition, each state is required to submit to HUD a ConPlan that includes a five-year housing and homeless needs assessment, a housing market analysis, a strategic plan that includes proposed housing and nonhousing community development activities, and a one-year action plan. Also, each state must submit to HUD a CAPER detailing progress it has made in meeting the goals and objectives outlined in its action plans.\n\n\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nThere are three categories of recipients eligible for direct allocations of CDBG program funds: entitlement communities (including insular areas), states, and Section 107 special project grants. Entitlement communities include central cities of metropolitan areas, metropolitan-based cities with populations of 50,000 or more, and statutorily defined urban counties. As of 2017, there were 1,224 entitlement communities, including the District of Columbia. States include the 50 states and Puerto Rico. Before funds are allocated to states and entitlement communities, a specific amount established by Congress is set aside annually for the United States territories or insular area of Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas. These funds are awarded annually based on each insular area's relative share of aggregate population for all insular areas. \nEligible activities include a wide range of projects such as public facilities and improvements, housing, public services, economic development, and brownfields redevelopment. State grantees must ensure that each activity meets one of the program's three national objectives: benefitting low- and moderate-income persons (the primary objective), aiding in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or assisting other community development needs that present a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community. Under the state program that assists smaller communities, states develop their own program and funding priorities and have considerable latitude to define community eligibility and criteria, within general criteria in law and regulations. \n\n\t\t\tFunding\n\nFor FY2017, Congress provided $3.0 billion for CDBG entitlement/nonentitlement formula funds, of which approximately $2.095 billion was available for entitlement communities, $898 million for smaller communities under the state nonentitlement program, and $7 million for insular areas. For FY2018, the President's budget requested $0 in funds for this program, the same as the FY2017 request level. On March 23, 2018, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, P.L. 115-141 . Division L of the act appropriated $3.365 billion for the HUD-administered Community Development Fund, including $3.3 billion for the CDBG entitlement/nonentitlement formula funds. Of the amount appropriated for CDBG formula grants, $2.305 billion was allocated to entitlement communities, $988 million to states for distribution to nonentitlement communities, and $7 million for insular areas. The act also appropriated $65 million for Indian tribes. For FY2019, the Administration again requested $0 in funds for the CDBG program. On February 15, 2019, Congress, passed and the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, P.L. 116-6 . The act left the program's funding level unchanged from the previous year, appropriating $3.365 billion\u2014including $2.305 for entitlement communities, $988 billion for states to distribute to nonentitlement communities, $7 million for insular areas, and $65 million for Indian tribes. The Administration's budget request for FY2020, released on March 11, 2019, does not include funding for the CDBG program. In proposing termination of the program in FY2020, the Administration cited its intent to redefine the proper role of the federal government in support of community and economic development by devolving responsibility to state and local governments.\n\n\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nStatutory authority for the CDBG program is Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq. ). Regulations are codified at 24 C.F.R. Part 570. Regulations covering the CDBG state program for nonentitlement communities are codified at 24 C.F.R. Part 570, Subpart I (\u00a7570.480).\n\n\t\tCDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantees\n\nAuthorized under the same title (Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974) as the formula-based CDBG program, the Section 108 loan guarantees allow an entitlement community or a state, on behalf of a nonentitlement community, to leverage its annual CDBG allocation in support of large-scale economic development and housing rehabilitation projects and the construction, reconstruction, or installation of public facilities. \n\n\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nConsistent with the goals and objectives of the CDBG program, Section 108 loan guarantees are intended to supplement CDBG program activities. The program allows entitlement communities and states to extend the reach of the formula-based CDBG program, giving them access to additional financial resources to undertake large-scale, transformative neighborhood revitalization efforts. \nEligible activities include acquiring and rehabilitating publicly owned real property; housing rehabilitation; economic development activities, including those carried out by for-profit and nonprofit entities; debt service reserves; payment of interest on the guaranteed loan; issuance cost of the public offering; and the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and installation of public facilities, including water and sewer improvements.\n\n\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nSection 108 loan guarantees are financed through public offerings. Under the program, states and communities are allowed to float bonds, notes, or debentures worth up to five times their annual CDBG allocation, minus any existing Section108 commitments or outstanding principal balances, with a repayment period of up to 20 years. States and entitlement communities must pledge their current and future CDBG allocations as security against default of the bonds or notes. Section 108 funds are made available on an ongoing basis, allowing communities to apply for funds any time during the year. It should be noted that Section 108 loan funds are made available to eligible public entities that may reloan the funds to private participants in a redevelopment project. Applicants are encouraged to meet with HUD staff prior to submitting a formal application.\n\n\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nSection 108 loan guarantees may be accessed only by CDBG entitlement communities and states on behalf of a CDBG nonentitlement community. All eligible activities must meet one of the three national objectives of the regular CDBG program: principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons, aid in eliminating or preventing slums and blight, or address an imminent threat to the health and safety of residents. The program has an open application process, allowing entitlement communities and states to submit applications anytime during the year. The application process governing the Section 108 program can be grouped into several distinct stages: application presubmission, citizen participation, application submission, application review and notification, award allocation, and reporting. \nWhen submitting formal applications, states and entitlement communities must include a description of activities to be carried out, financing structure, source of loan repayment, citizen participation plan, anti-displacement strategy, and a pledge of the applicant's CDBG allocation as security for the Section 108 guaranteed loan. In general, HUD attempts to review an application within 90 days. HUD field offices are encouraged to complete applications within 45 days, with HUD headquarters attempting to complete its review within 45 days. Recipients receiving Section 108 funds are required to file annual performance reports with HUD detailing progress made in meeting the objectives of their community development plans, including Section 108 activities. Between FY2014 and FY2016, HUD issued loan guarantee commitments totaling $314.4 million to 47 projects, including $110.4 million to 17 projects in FY2014, $123.3 million in loan guarantees to 20 projects in FY2015, and $80.7 million to support 10 projects in FY2016. \n\n\t\t\tFunding\n\nFor FY2017, Congress authorized a loan commitment ceiling of $300 million and directed HUD to collect fees from borrowers that results in a credit subsidy cost of zero for guaranteeing Section 108 loans. Until FY2015, Congress appropriated an amount necessary to cover the estimated long-term liability to the federal government of a Section 108 loan guarantee (credit subsidy). The Department of Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for FY2014 changed that arrangement, allowing HUD to collect a fee from the borrower to cover the cost of the credit subsidy. The amount of the fee will be determined annually by HUD based on a percentage of the principal amount of the Section 108 guaranteed loan. For FY2018, the Trump Administration did not request any new loan guarantee authority. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, P.L. 115-141 , signed by the President on March 3, 2018, included $300 million in Section 108 loan guarantee authority. For FY2019, the again requested no new loan guarantee authority. However, Congress, in passing the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, P.L. 116-6 , provided $300 million in loan guarantee authority for Section 108 financed projects. For FY2020, the Administration has requested no new loan guarantee authority for the Section 108 program. \n\n\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nStatutory authority for the Section 108 program is Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5308). Regulations are codified at 24 C.F.R. Part 570, Subpart M.\n[This section was prepared by Eugene Boyd, Analyst in Federalism and Economic Development Policy, Government and Finance Division.]\n\n\tDepartment of Commerce\n\n\t\tCommunity Development Block Grants\n\nHUD administers assistance in support of state and local government neighborhood revitalization and related community and economic development activities, including infrastructure improvements, primarily under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The program's primary objective is to develop viable communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. CDBG funds are used by state and local governments for a broad range of neighborhood revitalization and community and economic development activities intended to meet one of three national objectives. Specifically, eligible activities must\n1. principally benefit low- or moderate-income persons, 2. aid in preventing or eliminating slums and blight, or 3. address an imminent threat to the health and safety of residents. \nProgram policy requires that at least 70% of funds must benefit low- and moderate-income persons. \nThe block nature of the CDBG program provides local government discretion in selecting the eligible activities to be undertaken in pursuit of national objectives. Water and waste disposal needs compete with many other eligible activities for this assistance, including historical preservation, energy conservation, economic development, lead-based paint abatement, public facilities, and public service activities. Since it began in 1974, the CDBG program has invested $150 billion in communities nationwide. Congress has also used the program to provide supplemental appropriations to assist communities and states in response to natural disasters, the mortgage foreclosure crisis of 2008, economic recessions, and terrorist attacks. Since 1992, Congress has appropriated approximately $50 billion in supplemental CDBG funding to assist targeted states and local governments in their recovery efforts. Funds from the regular CDBG program have been disbursed across several broad categories, including the acquisition and demolition of real property, planning and administrative activities, housing, public services, and public improvements such as water and wastewater treatment facilities. During the five-year period from FY2012 to FY2016, CDBG expenditures for public improvement\u2014including water and sewer improvements\u2014accounted for approximately 33% of all CDBG funds expended. Water and sewer improvements accounted for 10% of total CDBG expenditures during the same five-year span. \nAfter subtracting amounts specified in appropriations acts for special-purpose activities, 70% of CDBG funds are allocated by formula to approximately 1,224 entitlement communities nationwide. These communities are defined as central cities of metropolitan areas, metropolitan cities with populations of 50,000 or more, and statutorily defined urban counties (the entitlement program). These funds are not available for projects in rural communities. The remaining 30% of CDBG funding is allocated by formula to the states for distribution to nonentitlement communities (the state program) for use in areas that are not part of a CDBG entitlement community allocation. These funds, which are administered by each state, may be available for rural community water projects. The 70/30 split and allocation formulas are provided for in law. Between FY2012 and FY2016, disbursements by CDBG recipients for water and sewer improvements have averaged $370 million per year. \n\n\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nThe primary goal of this program is the development of viable communities by providing decent housing, a suitable living environment, and expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income persons. Funds may also be used to aid in preventing or eliminating slums and blight or to address an imminent threat to residents of the impacted area.\n\n\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nCDBG program funds are allocated by formula. After amounts specified in an appropriations act are allocated to Section 107 special purpose activities, 70% of the remaining funds are allocated by formula to entitlement communities and 30% to the states for distribution to nonentitlement communities. Funds are awarded to entitlement communities based on the higher yield from one of two weighted formulas. The first of two formulas uses population, overcrowded housing, and poverty data, while the second formula allocates funds based on an entitlement community's relative share of poverty, housing built before 1940, and the lag in population growth rate relative to the total for all entitlement communities. Similar formulas are used to allocate nonentitlement funds to states.\nAs a condition of receiving CDBG funds, an entitlement community must submit a consolidated plan at least 45 days before the beginning of its program year detailing the proposed use of funds over a five-year period. Each entitlement community's multiyear consolidated plan (ConPlan) must include a citizen participation plan, a housing needs assessment, and an annual community development plan. In addition to an annual action plan, each jurisdiction must annually submit to HUD a Comprehensive Annual Performance Evaluation Report (CAPER) detailing progress it has made in meeting the goals and objectives outlined in its action plans.\nStates do not actually undertake eligible CDBG activities but act as pass-through agents charged with three distinct responsibilities: (1) determining the method or methods to be used to distribute funds to nonentitlement communities, including seeking the input of affected local governments; (2) selecting local governments that will receive funds; and (3) monitoring local government grant recipient project implementation to ensure compliance with rules governing the program. In addition, each state is required to submit to HUD a ConPlan that includes a five-year housing and homeless needs assessment, a housing market analysis, a strategic plan that includes proposed housing and nonhousing community development activities, and a one-year action plan. Also, each state must submit to HUD a CAPER detailing progress it has made in meeting the goals and objectives outlined in its action plans.\n\n\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nThere are three categories of recipients eligible for direct allocations of CDBG program funds: entitlement communities (including insular areas), states, and Section 107 special project grants. Entitlement communities include central cities of metropolitan areas, metropolitan-based cities with populations of 50,000 or more, and statutorily defined urban counties. As of 2017, there were 1,224 entitlement communities, including the District of Columbia. States include the 50 states and Puerto Rico. Before funds are allocated to states and entitlement communities, a specific amount established by Congress is set aside annually for the United States territories or insular area of Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas. These funds are awarded annually based on each insular area's relative share of aggregate population for all insular areas. \nEligible activities include a wide range of projects such as public facilities and improvements, housing, public services, economic development, and brownfields redevelopment. State grantees must ensure that each activity meets one of the program's three national objectives: benefitting low- and moderate-income persons (the primary objective), aiding in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or assisting other community development needs that present a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community. Under the state program that assists smaller communities, states develop their own program and funding priorities and have considerable latitude to define community eligibility and criteria, within general criteria in law and regulations. \n\n\t\t\tFunding\n\nFor FY2017, Congress provided $3.0 billion for CDBG entitlement/nonentitlement formula funds, of which approximately $2.095 billion was available for entitlement communities, $898 million for smaller communities under the state nonentitlement program, and $7 million for insular areas. For FY2018, the President's budget requested $0 in funds for this program, the same as the FY2017 request level. On March 23, 2018, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, P.L. 115-141 . Division L of the act appropriated $3.365 billion for the HUD-administered Community Development Fund, including $3.3 billion for the CDBG entitlement/nonentitlement formula funds. Of the amount appropriated for CDBG formula grants, $2.305 billion was allocated to entitlement communities, $988 million to states for distribution to nonentitlement communities, and $7 million for insular areas. The act also appropriated $65 million for Indian tribes. For FY2019, the Administration again requested $0 in funds for the CDBG program. On February 15, 2019, Congress, passed and the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, P.L. 116-6 . The act left the program's funding level unchanged from the previous year, appropriating $3.365 billion\u2014including $2.305 for entitlement communities, $988 billion for states to distribute to nonentitlement communities, $7 million for insular areas, and $65 million Indian tribes. The Administration's budget request for FY2020, released on March 11, 2019, does not include funding for the CDBG program. In proposing termination of the program in FY2020, the Administration cited its intent to redefine the proper role of the federal government in support of community and economic development by devolving responsibility to state and local governments. \n\n\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nStatutory authority for the CDBG program is Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq. ). Regulations are codified at 24 C.F.R. Part 570. Regulations covering the CDBG state program for nonentitlement communities are codified at 24 C.F.R. Part 570, Subpart I (\u00a7570.480).\n\n\t\tCDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantees\n\nAuthorized under the same title (Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974) as the formula-based CDBG program, the Section 108 loan guarantees allow an entitlement community or a state, on behalf of a nonentitlement community, to leverage its annual CDBG allocation in support of large-scale economic development and housing rehabilitation projects and the construction, reconstruction, or installation of public facilities. \n\n\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nConsistent with the goals and objectives of the CDBG program, Section 108 loan guarantees are intended to supplement CDBG program activities. The program allows entitlement communities and states to extend the reach of the formula-based CDBG program, giving them access to additional financial resources to undertake large-scale, transformative neighborhood revitalization efforts. \nEligible activities include acquiring and rehabilitating publicly owned real property; housing rehabilitation; economic development activities, including those carried out by for-profit and nonprofit entities; debt service reserves; payment of interest on the guaranteed loan; issuance cost of the public offering; and the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and installation of public facilities, including water and sewer improvements.\n\n\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nSection 108 loan guarantees are financed through public offerings. Under the program, states and communities are allowed to float bonds, notes, or debentures worth up to five times their annual CDBG allocation, minus any existing Section108 commitments or outstanding principal balances, with a repayment period of up to 20 years. States and entitlement communities must pledge their current and future CDBG allocations as security against default of the bonds or notes. Section 108 funds are made available on an ongoing basis, allowing communities to apply for funds anytime during the year. It should be noted that Section 108 loan funds are made available to eligible public entities that may reloan the funds to private participants in a redevelopment project. Applicants are encouraged to meet with HUD staff prior to submitting a formal application.\n\n\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nSection 108 loan guarantees may be accessed only by CDBG entitlement communities and states on behalf of a CDBG nonentitlement community. All eligible activities must meet one of the three national objectives of the regular CDBG program: principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons, aid in eliminating or preventing slums and blight, or address an imminent threat to the health and safety of residents. The program has an open application process, allowing entitlement communities and states to submit applications anytime during the year. The application process governing the Section 108 program can be grouped into several distinct stages: application presubmission, citizen participation, application submission, application review and notification, award allocation, and reporting. \nWhen submitting formal applications, states and entitlement communities must include a description of activities to be carried out, financing structure, source of loan repayment, citizen participation plan, anti-displacement strategy, and a pledge of the applicant's CDBG allocation as security for the Section 108 guaranteed loan. In general, HUD attempts to review an application within 90 days. HUD field offices are encouraged to complete applications within 45 days, with HUD headquarters attempting to complete its review within 45 days. Recipients receiving Section 108 funds are required to file annual performance reports with HUD detailing progress made in meeting the objectives of their community development plans, including Section 108 activities. Between FY2014 and FY2016, HUD issued loan guarantee commitments totaling $314.4 million to 47 projects, including $110.4 million to 17 projects in FY2014, $123.3 million in loan guarantees to 20 projects in FY2015, and $80.7 million to support 10 projects in FY2016. \n\n\t\t\tFunding\n\nFor FY2017, Congress authorized a loan commitment ceiling of $300 million and directed HUD to collect fees from borrowers that results in a credit subsidy cost of zero for guaranteeing Section 108 loans. Until FY2015, Congress appropriated an amount necessary to cover the estimated long-term liability to the federal government of a Section 108 loan guarantee (credit subsidy). The Department of Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for FY2014 changed that arrangement, allowing HUD to collect a fee from the borrower to cover the cost of the credit subsidy. The amount of the fee will be determined annually by HUD based on a percentage of the principal amount of the Section 108 guaranteed loan. For FY2018, the Trump Administration did not request any new loan guarantee authority. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, P.L. 115-141 , signed by the President on March 3, 2018, included $300 million in Section 108 loan guarantee authority. For FY2019, the Administration again requested no new loan guarantee authority. However, Congress, in passing the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, P.L. 116-6 , provided $300 million in loan guarantee authority for Section 108 financed projects. For FY2020, the Administration has requested no new loan guarantee authority for the Section 108 program. \n\n\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nStatutory authority for the Section 108 program is Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5308). Regulations are codified at 24 C.F.R. Part 570, Subpart M.\n[This section was prepared by Eugene Boyd, Analyst in Federalism and Economic Development Policy, Government and Finance Division.]\n\n\tDepartment of Commerce\n\n\t\tEconomic Development Administration (Public Works and Economic Development Facilities Program)\n\nThe Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA) is authorized to provide development assistance to areas experiencing substantial economic distress. EDA grants for community water and sewer projects are available through its Public Works and Economic Development Facilities program (PWED). Such assistance is also available under the agency's Economic Adjustment Assistance program.\nUnder the PWED program public works grants are awarded competitively to eligible applicants to revitalize, expand, and upgrade their physical infrastructure. These investments in public works improvements must be linked to projects intended to enable communities to attract new industry, encourage business expansion and retention, diversify local economies, and generate or retain private sector jobs in EDA-designated distressed regions. Grants may be used for a wide range of purposes but frequently have a sewer or water supply element. \nThe types of projects funded include industrial parks, expansion of port and harbor facilities, redevelopment of brownfields, and water and wastewater facilities primarily serving industry and commerce. Federal law requires that units of government retain ownership of EDA-funded projects. Because EDA grants must directly encourage employment generation, these grants generally are not available for rural residential sewer and water supply development.\n\n\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the program is to promote long-term economic development and assist in the construction of public works and development facilities needed to initiate and support the creation or retention of permanent private sector jobs in areas experiencing long-term economic deterioration and distress. EDA's public works program supports investments that will help distressed areas address their competitive disadvantages. Funded projects must be part of an EDA-certified Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS).\n\n\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nEDA competitively awards public works grants directly to approved applicants. Generally, EDA investment assistance may not exceed 50% of the project cost. Projects may receive an additional amount, not to exceed 30%, based on the relative needs of the region in which the project will be located, as determined by EDA. In the case of certain Indian tribes, nonprofit organizations that have exhausted their effective borrowing capacity, or a state or political subdivision of a state that has exhausted its effective taxing and borrowing capacity, grants totaling 100% of a project's cost may be awarded. Credit may be given toward the nonfederal share for in-kind contributions, including contributions of space, equipment, and services. No minimum or maximum project amount is specified in law.\n\n\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nPublic works grants may be made to states, cities, counties and other political subdivisions of states, an institution of higher education or a consortium of such institutions, and private or public not-for-profit organizations acting in cooperation with officials of a political subdivision of a state. Under this program, the term \"state\" includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. For-profit, private sector entities do not qualify.\nQualified projects must fill a pressing need of the area and must (1) be intended to improve the opportunities for the successful establishment of businesses, (2) assist in the creation of additional long-term private sector employment, and (3) benefit long-term unemployed or underemployed persons and low-income families. Projects must also be consistent with the area's CEDS and have an adequate share of local funds. In addition, eligible projects must be located in areas that meet at least one of the following criteria: low per-capita income, unemployment above the national average, or an actual or anticipated abrupt rise in unemployment.\n\n\t\t\tFunding\n\nFor FY2017, Congress provided appropriations totaling $100 million for EDA's public works grant program. For FY2018, the President's budget requested no funding for the public works program. On March 23, 2018, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, P.L. 115-141 . Division B of the act appropriated $262.5 million for EDA programs and additional $39 million for salaries and expenses. Of the amount appropriated for EDA programs, $117.5 million is allocated for the public works program. On February 15, 2019, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, P.L. 116-6 . The act appropriated $265 million for EDA programs, including $117 million for the public works program. The act also appropriated an additional $39 million for EDA salaries and expenses. This is the same amount appropriated for FY2018. The Administration's FY2020 budget requests no new funding for EDA program activities but does request $30 million to cover the costs associated with closing down the agency.\n\n\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nThe statutory authority for the public works program is the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended, P.L. 89-136 (42 U.S.C. 3121 et seq. ). Regulations are codified at 13 C.F.R. Chapter III, Part 302, 305, 316, and 317. \n\n\t\tEconomic Adjustment Assistance (EAA)\n\nEDA, through its Economic Adjustment Assistance (EAA) grant program, awards development assistance to areas experiencing long-term economic deterioration and distress or sudden and substantial economic dislocation. This may include assisting communities/regions affected by natural disasters, natural resource depletion, mass layoffs, and other severe economic shocks that communities experience in restructuring and diversifying their regional economies. Funds have also been made available to aid communities experiencing chronic unemployment and underinvestment and communities impacted by military Base Realignments and Closures (BRAC).\nEAA funds are competitively awarded to qualified applicants to assist them in developing and implementing a five-year CEDS. EAA may be used to fund four types of activities: \n1. strategic planning activities that include the creation of short-term action plans intended to stabilize a distressed community and regionally oriented long-term development strategies (CEDS) intended to assess and redirect the region's economic future; 2. technical assistance, including feasibility studies; 3. capitalization of revolving loan funds, which would allow qualifying businesses to borrow funds at favorable interest rates; and 4. financing of physical infrastructure projects, including water and sewer facilities, industrial parks, and business incubators. \n\n\t\t\tProgram Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the program is to promote long-term economic development in areas experiencing sudden economic dislocation or long-term economic distress. EDA's EAA program supports investments that will help distressed areas address their competitive disadvantages and rethink their economic futures. In general, funds may be used to develop CEDS, and funded projects must be part of EDA-certified CEDS.\n\n\t\t\tFinancing Mechanism\n\nEDA competitively awards EAA grants directly to approved applicants. Generally, EAA investment assistance may not exceed 50% of the project cost. Projects may receive an additional amount, not to exceed 30%, based on the relative needs of the region in which the project will be located, as determined by EDA. In the case of certain Indian tribes and nonprofit organizations that have exhausted their effective borrowing capacity, or a state or political subdivision of a state that has exhausted its effective taxing and borrowing capacity, grants totaling 100% may be awarded. Credit may be given toward the nonfederal share for in-kind contributions, including contributions of space, equipment, and services. No minimum or maximum project amount is specified in law.\n\n\t\t\tEligibility Requirements\n\nEAA grants may be made to states, cities, counties and other political subdivisions of states, institutions of higher education or consortia of such institutions, and private or public nonprofit organizations acting in cooperation with officials of political subdivisions of a state. Under this program, the term state includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. For-profit, private sector entities do not qualify.\nQualified projects must fill a pressing need of the area and must (1) be intended to improve the opportunities for the successful establishment of businesses, (2) assist in the creation of additional long-term private sector employment, and (3) benefit long-term unemployed or underemployed persons and low-income families. Projects must also be consistent with the area's CEDS and have an adequate share of local funds. In addition, eligible projects must be located in areas that meet at least one of the following criteria: low per-capita income, unemployment above the national average, or an actual or anticipated abrupt rise in unemployment.\n\n\t\t\tFunding\n\nFor FY2017, Congress provided appropriations totaling $35 million for EDA's EAA grant program. For FY2018, the President's budget requested $0 for the EAA program. On March 23, 2018, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, P.L. 115-141 , which included $262.5 million for EDA programs and additional $39 million for salaries and expenses. Of the amount appropriated for EDA programs, $37 million was allocated for the EAA program. On February 15, 2019, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, P.L. 116-6 . The act appropriated $265 million for EDA programs, including $37 million for the EAA program. For FY2020, the Administration seeks to terminate EDA and its programs, citing changing national priorities, including prioritizing rebuilding the military and making critical investments in the nation's security. The Administration is requesting $30 million for salaries and expenses to cover the cost of shutting down the agency. \n\n\t\t\tStatutory and Regulatory Authority\n\nThe statutory authority for the public works program is the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended, P.L. 89-136 (42 U.S.C. 3121 et seq. ). Regulations are codified at 13 C.F.R. Chapter III, Part 302, 305, 316, and 317.\n[This section was prepared by Eugene Boyd, Analyst in Federalism and Economic Development Policy, Government and Finance Division.]\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "For more than four decades, Congress has authorized and refined several programs to help communities address water supply and wastewater problems. The agencies that administer these programs differ in multiple ways. In terms of funding mechanisms, projects developed by the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) typically require direct, individual project authorizations from Congress.\nIn contrast, standing program authorizations provide project funding for other agencies, including\nthe Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\nThe key practical difference is that with the individual project authorizations, there is no predictable assistance or even guarantee of funding after a project is authorized, because funding must be secured each year in the congressional appropriations process. The programs, on the other hand, have set program criteria, are generally funded from year to year, and provide a process under which project sponsors compete for funding.\nIn terms of scope and mission, the primary responsibilities of USACE are to maintain inland navigation, provide for flood and storm damage reduction, and restore aquatic ecosystems, while EPA's mission relates to protecting public health and the environment. The Department of Commerce and HUD focus on community and economic development. Likewise, the specific programs\u2014while all address water supply and wastewater treatment to some degree\u2014differ in important respects. Some are national in scope (those of USDA, EPA, and the Department of Commerce, for example), while others are regionally focused (Reclamation's programs and projects). Some focus primarily on urban areas (HUD) and some on rural areas (USDA), and others do not distinguish based on community size (e.g., EPA, USACE).\nFederal funding for the programs and projects discussed in this report varies greatly. Collectively, congressional funding for these programs in recent years has been somewhat eroded by overall competition among the many programs that are supported by discretionary spending, despite the continuing pressure from stakeholders and others for increased funding. FY2019 appropriations highlights include the following:\n$1.164 billion for capitalization grants to states under EPA's State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan program for drinking water systems and $1.694 billion for EPA's SRF program for wastewater projects; $60 million in subsidy costs for the EPA-administered Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program, allowing the agency to provide approximately $5.5 billion in credit assistance for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects; $400 million for USDA's rural water and waste disposal grant program and direct loan authority of approximately $1.4 billion; $3.4 billion for HUD Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds (water and wastewater projects are among many eligible uses); and $58.6 million for Reclamation's Title XVI reclamation/recycling projects.",

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nIntroduction\n\nThis report presents background information and issues for Congress concerning the Navy's force structure and shipbuilding plans. The current and planned size and composition of the Navy, the rate of Navy ship procurement, and the prospective affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plans have been oversight matters for the congressional defense committees for many years.\nThe Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships.\nThe issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's proposed FY2020 shipbuilding program and the Navy's longer-term shipbuilding plans. Decisions that Congress makes on this issue can substantially affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements, and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base.\nDetailed coverage of certain individual Navy shipbuilding programs can be found in the following CRS reports:\nCRS Report R41129, Navy Columbia (SSBN-826) Class Ballistic Missile Submarine Program: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke.

CRS Report R43546, Navy John Lewis (TAO-205) Class Oiler Shipbuilding Program: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke.\nFor a discussion of the strategic and budgetary context in which U.S. Navy force structure and shipbuilding plans may be considered, see Appendix A .\n\n\tBackground\n\n\t\tNavy's 355-Ship Ship Force-Structure Goal\n\n\t\t\tIntroduction\n\nOn December 15, 2016, the Navy released a force-structure goal that calls for achieving and maintaining a fleet of 355 ships of certain types and numbers. The 355-ship force-level goal replaced a 308-ship force-level goal that the Navy released in March 2015. The 355-ship force-level goal is the largest force-level goal that the Navy has released since a 375-ship force-level goal that was in place in 2002-2004. In the years between that 375-ship goal and the 355-ship goal, Navy force-level goals were generally in the low 300s (see Appendix B ). The force level of 355 ships is a goal to be attained in the future; the actual size of the Navy in recent years has generally been between 270 and 290 ships. Table 1 shows the composition of the 355-ship force-level objective.\n\n\t\t\t355-Ship Goal Resulted from 2016 Force Structure Assessment (FSA)\n\nThe 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. An FSA is an analysis in which the Navy solicits inputs from U.S. regional combatant commanders (CCDRs) regarding the types and amounts of Navy capabilities that CCDRs deem necessary for implementing the Navy's portion of the national military strategy and then translates those CCDR inputs into required numbers of ships, using current and projected Navy ship types. The analysis takes into account Navy capabilities for both warfighting and day-to-day forward-deployed presence. Although the result of the FSA is often reduced for convenience to single number (e.g., 355 ships), FSAs take into account a number of factors, including types and capabilities of Navy ships, aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and weapons, as well as ship homeporting arrangements and operational cycles. The Navy conducts a new FSA or an update to the existing FSA every few years, as circumstances require, to determine its force-structure goal.\n\n\t\t\t355-Ship Goal Made U.S. Policy by FY2018 NDAA\n\nSection 1025 of the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA ( H.R. 2810 / P.L. 115-91 of December 12, 2017), states the following:\nSEC. 1025. Policy of the United States on minimum number of battle force ships.\n(a) Policy.\u2014It shall be the policy of the United States to have available, as soon as practicable, not fewer than 355 battle force ships, comprised of the optimal mix of platforms, with funding subject to the availability of appropriations or other funds.\n(b) Battle force ships defined.\u2014In this section, the term \"battle force ship\" has the meaning given the term in Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5030.8C.\nThe term battle force ships in the above provision refers to the ships that count toward the quoted size of the Navy in public policy discussions about the Navy.\n\n\t\t\tNew FSA Now Being Done Could Change 355-Ship Figure and Force Mix\n\nThe Navy states that a new FSA is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA, and that this new FSA is to be completed by the end of 2019. The new FSA, Navy officials state, will take into account the Trump Administration's December 2017 National Security Strategy document and its January 2018 National Defense Strategy document, both of which put an emphasis on renewed great power competition with China and Russia, as well as updated information on Chinese and Russian naval and other military capabilities and recent developments in new technologies, including those related to unmanned vehicles (UVs).\nNavy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. Some observers, viewing statements by Navy officials, believe the new FSA in particular might shift the Navy's surface force to a more distributed architecture that includes a reduced proportion of large surface combatants (i.e., cruisers and destroyers), an increased proportion of small surface combatants (i.e., frigates and LCSs), and a newly created third tier of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Some observers believe the new FSA might also change the Navy's undersea force to a more distributed architecture that includes, in addition to attack submarines (SSNs) and bottom-based sensors, a new element of extremely large unmanned underwater vehicles (XLUUVs), which might be thought of as unmanned submarines. In presenting its proposed FY2020 budget, the Navy highlighted its plans for developing and procuring USVs and UUVs in coming years.\nShifting to a more distributed force architecture, Navy officials have suggested, could be appropriate for implementing the Navy's new overarching operational concept, called Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO). Observers view DMO as a response to both China's improving maritime anti-access/area denial capabilities (which include advanced weapons for attacking Navy surface ships) and opportunities created by new technologies, including technologies for UVs and for networking Navy ships, aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and sensors into distributed battle networks.\n Figure 1 shows a Navy briefing slide depicting the Navy's potential new surface force architecture, with each sphere representing a manned ship or a USV. Consistent with Figure 1 , the Navy's 355-ship goal, reflecting the current force architecture, calls for a Navy with twice as many large surface combatants as small surface combatants. Figure 1 suggests that the potential new surface force architecture could lead to the obverse\u2014a planned force mix that calls for twice as many small surface combatants than large surface combatants\u2014along with a new third tier of numerous USVs.\nObservers believe the new FSA might additionally change the top-level metric used to express the Navy's force-level goal or the method used to count the size of the Navy, or both, to include large USVs and large UUVs.\n\n\t\tNavy's Five-Year and 30-Year Shipbuilding Plans\n\n\t\t\tFY2020 Five-Year (FY2020-FY2024) Shipbuilding Plan\n\n Table 2 shows the Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2024) shipbuilding plan. The table also shows, for reference purposes, the ships funded for procurement in FY2019. The figures in the table reflect a Navy decision to show the aircraft carrier CVN-81 as a ship to be procured in FY2020 rather than a ship that was procured in FY2019. Congress, as part of its action on the Navy's proposed FY2019 budget, authorized the procurement of CVN-81 in FY2019.\nAs shown in Table 2 , the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. If the Navy had listed CVN-81 as a ship procured in FY2019 rather than a ship to be procured in FY2020, then the total numbers of ships in FY2019 and FY2020 would be 14 and 11, respectively.\nAs also shown Table 2 , the Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2024) shipbuilding plan includes 55 new ships, or an average of 11 new ships per year. The Navy's FY2019 budget submission also included a total of 55 ships in the period FY2020-FY2024, but the mix of ships making up the total of 55 for these years has been changed under the FY2020 budget submission to include one additional attack submarine, one additional FFG(X) frigate, and two (rather than four) LPD-17 Flight II amphibious ships over the five-year period. The FY2020 submission also makes some changes within the five-year period to annual procurement quantities for DDG-51 destroyers, ESBs, and TAO-205s without changing the five-year totals for these programs.\nCompared to what was projected for FY2020 itself under the FY2019 budget submission, the FY2020 request accelerates from FY2023 to FY2020 the aircraft carrier CVN-81 (as a result of Congress's action to authorize the ship in FY2019), adds a third attack submarine, accelerates from FY2021 into FY2020 a third DDG-51, defers from FY2020 to FY2021 an LPD-17 Flight II amphibious ship to FY2021, defers from FY2020 to FY2023 an ESB ship, and accelerates from FY2021 to FY2020 a second TAO-205 class oiler.\n\n\t\t\tFY2020 30-Year (FY2020-FY2049) Shipbuilding Plan\n\n Table 3 shows the Navy's FY2020-FY2049 30-year shipbuilding plan. In devising a 30-year shipbuilding plan to move the Navy toward its ship force-structure goal, key assumptions and planning factors include but are not limited to ship construction times and service lives, estimated ship procurement costs, projected shipbuilding funding levels, and industrial-base considerations. As shown in Table 3 , the Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 304 new ships, or an average of about 10 per year.\n\n\t\t\tProjected Force Levels Under FY2020 30-Year Shipbuilding Plan\n\n\t\t\t\tOverview\n\n Table 4 shows the Navy's projection of ship force levels for FY2020-FY2049 that would result from implementing the FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) 30-year shipbuilding plan shown in Table 3 .\nAs shown in Table 4 , if the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan is implemented, the Navy projects that it will achieve a total of 355 ships by FY2034. This is about 20 years sooner than projected under the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan. This is not primarily because the FY2020 30-year plan includes more ships than did the FY2019 plan: The total of 304 ships in the FY2020 plan is only three ships higher than the total of 301 ships in the FY2019 plan. Instead, it is primarily due to a decision announced by the Navy in April 2018, after the FY2019 budget was submitted, to increase the service lives of all DDG-51 destroyers\u2014both those existing and those to be built in the future\u2014to 45 years. Prior to this decision, the Navy had planned to keep older DDG-51s (referred to as the Flight I/II DDG-51s) in service for 35 years and newer DDG-51s (the Flight II/III DDG-51s) for 40 years. Figure 2 shows the Navy's projections for the total number of ships in the Navy under the Navy's FY2019 and FY2020 budget submissions. As can be seen in the figure, the Navy projected under the FY2019 plan that the fleet would not reach a total of 355 ships any time during the 30-year period.\n\n\t\t\t\tAdjustment Needed for Withdrawn Proposal Regarding CVN-75 RCOH\n\nThe projected number of aircraft carriers in Table 4 , the projected total number of all ships in Table 4 , and the line showing the total number of ships under the Navy's FY2020 budget submission in Figure 2 all reflect the Navy's proposal, under its FY2020 budget submission, to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (called a refueling complex overhaul, or RCOH) of the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman (CVN-75), and to instead retire CVN-75 around FY2024. On April 30, 2019, however, the Administration announced that it was withdrawing this proposal from the Navy's FY2020 budget submission. The Administration now supports funding the CVN-75 RCOH and keeping CVN-75 in service past FY2024.\nAs a result of the withdrawal of its proposal regarding the CVN-75 RCOH, the projected number of aircraft carriers and consequently the projected total number of all ships are now one ship higher for the period FY2022-FY2047 than what is shown in Table 4 , and the line in Figure 2 would be adjusted upward by one ship for those years. (The figures in Table 4 are left unchanged from what is shown in the FY2020 budget submission so as to accurately reflect what is shown in that budget submission.)\n\n\t\t\t\t355-Ship Total Attained 20 Years Sooner; Mix Does Not Match FSA Mix\n\nAs shown in Table 4 , although the Navy projects that the fleet will reach a total of 355 ships in FY2034, the Navy in that year and subsequent years will not match the composition called for in the FY2016 FSA. Among other things, the Navy will have more than the required number of large surface combatants (i.e., cruisers and destroyers) from FY2030 through FY2040 (a consequence of the decision to extend the service lives of DDG-51s to 45 years), fewer than the required number of aircraft carriers through the end of the 30-year period, fewer than the required number of attack submarines through FY2047, and fewer than the required number of amphibious ships through the end of the 30-year period. The Navy acknowledges that the mix of ships will not match that called for by the 2016 FSA but states that if the Navy is going to have too many ships of a certain kind, DDG-51s are not a bad type of ship to have too many of, because they are very capable multi-mission ships.\n\n\tIssues for Congress\n\n\t\tWhether New FSA Will Change 355-Ship Goal and, If So, How\n\nOne issue for Congress is whether the new FSA that the Navy is conducting will change the 355-ship force-level objective established by the 2016 FSA and, if so, in what ways. As discussed earlier, Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could shift the Navy toward a more distributed force architecture, which could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. The issue for Congress is how to assess the appropriateness of the Navy's FY2020 shipbuilding plans when a key measuring stick for conducting that assessment\u2014the Navy's force-level goal and planned force mix\u2014might soon change.\n\n\t\tAffordability of 30-Year Shipbuilding Plan\n\n\t\t\tOverview\n\nAnother oversight issue for Congress concerns the prospective affordability of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan. This issue has been a matter of oversight focus for several years, and particularly since the enactment in 2011 of the Budget Control Act, or BCA ( S. 365 / P.L. 112-25 of August 2, 2011). Observers have been particularly concerned about the plan's prospective affordability during the decade or so from the mid-2020s through the mid-2030s, when the plan calls for procuring Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines as well as replacements for large numbers of retiring attack submarines, cruisers, and destroyers.\n Figure 3 shows, in a graphic form, the Navy's estimate of the annual amounts of funding that would be needed to implement the Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan. The figure shows that during the period from the mid-2020s through the mid-2030s, the Navy estimates that implementing the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan would require roughly $24 billion per year in shipbuilding funds.\n\n\t\t\tConcern Regarding Potential Impact of Columbia-Class Program\n\nAs discussed in the CRS report on the Columbia-class program, the Navy since 2013 has identified the Columbia-class program as its top program priority, meaning that it is the Navy's intention to fully fund this program, if necessary at the expense of other Navy programs, including other Navy shipbuilding programs. This led to concerns that in a situation of finite Navy shipbuilding budgets, funding requirements for the Columbia-class program could crowd out funding for procuring other types of Navy ships. These concerns in turn led to the creation by Congress of the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund (NSBDF), a fund in the DOD budget that is intended in part to encourage policymakers to identify funding for the Columbia-class program from sources across the entire DOD budget rather than from inside the Navy's budget alone.\nSeveral years ago, when concerns arose about the potential impact of the Columbia-class program on funding available for other Navy shipbuilding programs, the Navy's shipbuilding budget was roughly $14 billion per year, and the roughly $7 billion per year that the Columbia-class program is projected to require from the mid-2020s to the mid-2030s (see Figure 3 ) represented roughly one-half of that total. With the Navy's shipbuilding budget having grown in more recent years to a total of roughly $24 billion per year, the $7 billion per year projected to be required by the Columbia-class program during those years does not loom proportionately as large as it once did in the Navy's shipbuilding budget picture. Even so, some concerns remain regarding the potential impact of the Columbia-class program on funding available for other Navy shipbuilding programs.\n\n\t\t\tPotential for Cost Growth on Navy Ships\n\nIf one or more Navy ship designs turn out to be more expensive to build than the Navy estimates, then the projected funding levels shown in Figure 3 would not be sufficient to procure all the ships shown in the 30-year shipbuilding plan. As detailed by CBO and GAO, lead ships in Navy shipbuilding programs in many cases have turned out to be more expensive to build than the Navy had estimated. Ship designs that can be viewed as posing a risk of being more expensive to build than the Navy estimates include Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carriers, Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines, Virginia-class attack submarines equipped with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), Flight III versions of the DDG-51 destroyer, FFG(X) frigates, LPD-17 Flight II amphibious ships, and John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, as well as other new classes of ships that the Navy wants to begin procuring years from now.\n\n\t\t\tCBO Estimate\n\nThe statute that requires the Navy to submit a 30-year shipbuilding plan each year (10 U.S.C. 231) also requires CBO to submit its own independent analysis of the potential cost of the 30-year plan (10 U.S.C. 231[d]). CBO is now preparing its estimate of the cost of the Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan. In the meantime, Figure 4 shows, in a graphic form, CBO's estimate of the annual amounts of funding that would be needed to implement the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan. This figure might be compared to the Navy's estimate of its FY2020 30-year plan as shown in Figure 3 , although doing so poses some apples-vs.-oranges issues, as the Navy's FY2019 and FY2020 30-year plans do not cover exactly the same 30-year periods, and for the years they do have in common, there are some differences in types and numbers of ships to be procured in certain years.\nCBO analyses of past Navy 30-year shipbuilding plans have generally estimated the cost of implementing those plans to be higher than what the Navy estimated. Consistent with that past pattern, as shown in Table 5 , CBO's estimate of the cost to implement the Navy's FY2019 30-year (FY2019-FY2048) shipbuilding plan is about 27% higher than the Navy's estimated cost for the FY2019 plan. ( Table 5 does not pose an apples-vs.-oranges issue, because both the Navy and CBO estimates in this table are for the Navy's FY2019 30-year plan.) More specifically, as shown in the table, CBO estimated that the cost of the first 10 years of the FY2019 30-year plan would be about 2% higher than the Navy's estimate; that the cost of the middle 10 years of the plan would be about 13% higher than the Navy's estimate; and that the cost of the final 10 years of the plan would be about 27% higher than the Navy's estimate.\n\n\t\t\t\tTreatment of Inflation\n\nThe growing divergence between CBO's estimate and the Navy's estimate as one moves from the first 10 years of the 30-year plan to the final 10 years of the plan is due in part to a technical difference between CBO and the Navy regarding the treatment of inflation. This difference compounds over time, making it increasingly important as a factor in the difference between CBO's estimates and the Navy's estimates the further one goes into the 30-year period. In other words, other things held equal, this factor tends to push the CBO and Navy estimates further apart as one proceeds from the earlier years of the plan to the later years of the plan.\n\n\t\t\t\tDesigns of Future Classes of Ships\n\nThe growing divergence between CBO's estimate and the Navy's estimate as one moves from the first 10 years of the 30-year plan to the final 10 years of the plan is also due to differences between CBO and the Navy about the costs of certain ship classes, particularly classes that are projected to be procured starting years from now. The designs of these future ship classes are not yet determined, creating more potential for CBO and the Navy to come to differing conclusions regarding their potential cost. For the FY2019 30-year plan, the largest source of difference between CBO and the Navy regarding the costs of individual ship classes was a new class of SSNs that the Navy wants to begin procuring in FY2034 as the successor to the Virginia-class SSN design. This new class of SSN, CBO says, accounted for 42% of the difference between the CBO and Navy estimates for the FY2019 30-year plan, in part because there were a substantial number of these SSNs in the plan, and because those ships occur in the latter years of the plan, where the effects of the technical difference between CBO and the Navy regarding the treatment of inflation show more strongly.\nThe second-largest source of difference between CBO and the Navy regarding the costs of individual ship classes was a new class of large surface combatant (i.e., cruiser or destroyer) that the Navy wants to begin procuring in the future, which accounted for 20% of the difference, for reasons that are similar to those mentioned above for the new class of SSNs. The third-largest source of difference was the new class of frigates (FFG[X]s) that the Navy wants to begin procuring in FY2020, which accounts for 9% of the difference. The remaining 29% of difference between the CBO and Navy estimates was accounted for collectively by several other shipbuilding programs, each of which individually accounts for between 1% and 4% of the difference. The Columbia-class program, which accounted for 4%, is one of the programs in this final group.\n\n\tLegislative Activity for FY2020\n\n\t\tCRS Reports Tracking Legislation on Specific Navy Shipbuilding Programs\n\nDetailed coverage of legislative activity on certain Navy shipbuilding programs (including funding levels, legislative provisions, and report language) can be found in the following CRS reports:\nCRS Report R41129, Navy Columbia (SSBN-826) Class Ballistic Missile Submarine Program: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke.

Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier; 3 Virginia-class attack submarines; 3 DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers; 1 FFG(X) frigate; 2 John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers; and 2 TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships.\nAs noted earlier, the above list of 12 ships reflects a Navy decision to show the aircraft carrier CVN-81 as a ship to be procured in FY2020 rather than a ship that was procured in FY2019. Congress, as part of its action on the Navy's proposed FY2019 budget, authorized the procurement of CVN-81 in FY2019.\nThe Navy's proposed FY2020 shipbuilding budget also requests funding for ships that have been procured in prior fiscal years, and ships that are to be procured in future fiscal years, as well as funding for activities other than the building of new Navy ships.\n Table 6 summarizes congressional action on the Navy's FY2020 funding request for Navy shipbuilding. The table shows the amounts requested and congressional changes to those requested amounts. A blank cell in a filled-in column showing congressional changes to requested amounts indicates no change from the requested amount. \nAppendix A. Strategic and Budgetary Context\nThis appendix presents some brief comments on elements of the strategic and budgetary context in which U.S. Navy force structure and shipbuilding plans may be considered.\nShift in International Security Environment\nWorld events have led some observers, starting in late 2013, to conclude that the international security environment has undergone a shift over the past several years from the familiar post-Cold War era of the past 20-25 years, also sometimes known as the unipolar moment (with the United States as the unipolar power), to a new and different strategic situation that features, among other things, renewed great power competition with China and Russia, and challenges to elements of the U.S.-led international order that has operated since World War II. This situation is discussed further in another CRS report.\nWorld Geography and U.S. Grand Strategy\nDiscussion of the above-mentioned shift in the international security environment has led to a renewed emphasis in discussions of U.S. security and foreign policy on grand strategy and geopolitics. From a U.S. perspective on grand strategy and geopolitics, it can be noted that most of the world's people, resources, and economic activity are located not in the Western Hemisphere, but in the other hemisphere, particularly Eurasia. In response to this basic feature of world geography, U.S. policymakers for the past several decades have chosen to pursue, as a key element of U.S. national strategy, a goal of preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in one part of Eurasia or another, on the grounds that such a hegemon could represent a concentration of power strong enough to threaten core U.S. interests by, for example, denying the United States access to some of the other hemisphere's resources and economic activity. Although U.S. policymakers have not often stated this key national strategic goal explicitly in public, U.S. military (and diplomatic) operations in recent decades\u2014both wartime operations and day-to-day operations\u2014can be viewed as having been carried out in no small part in support of this key goal.\nU.S. Grand Strategy and U.S. Naval Forces\nAs noted above, in response to basic world geography, U.S. policymakers for the past several decades have chosen to pursue, as a key element of U.S. national strategy, a goal of preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in one part of Eurasia or another. The traditional U.S. goal of preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in one part of Eurasia or another has been a major reason why the U.S. military is structured with force elements that enable it to cross broad expanses of ocean and air space and then conduct sustained, large-scale military operations upon arrival. Force elements associated with this goal include, among other things, an Air Force with significant numbers of long-range bombers, long-range surveillance aircraft, long-range airlift aircraft, and aerial refueling tankers, and a Navy with significant numbers of aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered attack submarines, large surface combatants, large amphibious ships, and underway replenishment ships. \nThe United States is the only country in the world that has designed its military to cross broad expanses of ocean and air space and then conduct sustained, large-scale military operations upon arrival. The other countries in the Western Hemisphere do not design their forces to do this because they cannot afford to, and because the United States has been, in effect, doing it for them. Countries in the other hemisphere do not design their forces to do this for the very basic reason that they are already in the other hemisphere, and consequently instead spend their defense money on forces that are tailored largely for influencing events in their own local region.\nThe fact that the United States has designed its military to do something that other countries do not design their forces to do\u2014cross broad expanses of ocean and air space and then conduct sustained, large-scale military operations upon arrival\u2014can be important to keep in mind when comparing the U.S. military to the militaries of other nations. For example, in observing that the U.S. Navy has 11 aircraft carriers while other countries have no more than one or two, it can be noted other countries do not need a significant number of aircraft carriers because, unlike the United States, they are not designing their forces to cross broad expanses of ocean and air space and then conduct sustained, large-scale military operations upon arrival.\nAs another example, it is sometimes noted, in assessing the adequacy of U.S. naval forces, that U.S. naval forces are equal in tonnage to the next dozen or more navies combined, and that most of those next dozen or more navies are the navies of U.S. allies. Those other fleets, however, are mostly of Eurasian countries, which do not design their forces to cross to the other side of the world and then conduct sustained, large-scale military operations upon arrival. The fact that the U.S. Navy is much bigger than allied navies does not necessarily prove that U.S. naval forces are either sufficient or excessive; it simply reflects the differing and generally more limited needs that U.S. allies have for naval forces. (It might also reflect an underinvestment by some of those allies to meet even their more limited naval needs.)\nCountries have differing needs for naval and other military forces. The United States, as a country located in the Western Hemisphere that has adopted a goal of preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in one part of Eurasia or another, has defined a need for naval and other military forces that is quite different from the needs of allies that are located in Eurasia. The sufficiency of U.S. naval and other military forces consequently is best assessed not through comparison to the militaries of other countries, but against U.S. strategic goals.\nMore generally, from a geopolitical perspective, it can be noted that that U.S. naval forces, while not inexpensive, give the United States the ability to convert the world's oceans\u2014a global commons that covers more than two-thirds of the planet's surface\u2014into a medium of maneuver and operations for projecting U.S. power ashore and otherwise defending U.S. interests around the world. The ability to use the world's oceans in this manner\u2014and to deny other countries the use of the world's oceans for taking actions against U.S. interests\u2014constitutes an immense asymmetric advantage for the United States. This point would be less important if less of the world were covered by water, or if the oceans were carved into territorial blocks, like the land. Most of the world, however, is covered by water, and most of those waters are international waters, where naval forces can operate freely. The point, consequently, is not that U.S. naval forces are intrinsically special or privileged\u2014it is that they have a certain value simply as a consequence of the physical and legal organization of the planet.\nUncertainty Regarding Future U.S. Role in the World\nThe overall U.S. role in the world since the end of World War II in 1945 (i.e., over the past 70 years) is generally described as one of global leadership and significant engagement in international affairs. A key aim of that role has been to promote and defend the open international order that the United States, with the support of its allies, created in the years after World War II. In addition to promoting and defending the open international order, the overall U.S. role is generally described as having been one of promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights, while criticizing and resisting authoritarianism where possible, and opposing the emergence of regional hegemons in Eurasia or a spheres-of-influence world.\nCertain statements and actions from the Trump Administration have led to uncertainty about the Administration's intentions regarding the U.S. role in the world. Based on those statements and actions, some observers have speculated that the Trump Administration may want to change the U.S. role in one or more ways. A change in the overall U.S. role could have profound implications for DOD strategy, budgets, plans, and programs, including the planned size and structure of the Navy.\nDeclining U.S. Technological and Qualitative Edge\nDOD officials have expressed concern that the technological and qualitative edge that U.S. military forces have had relative to the military forces of other countries is being narrowed by improving military capabilities in other countries. China's improving military capabilities are a primary contributor to that concern. Russia's rejuvenated military capabilities are an additional contributor. DOD in recent years has taken a number of actions to arrest and reverse the decline in the U.S. technological and qualitative edge.\nChallenge to U.S. Sea Control and U.S. Position in Western Pacific\nObservers of Chinese and U.S. military forces view China's improving naval capabilities as posing a potential challenge in the Western Pacific to the U.S. Navy's ability to achieve and maintain control of blue-water ocean areas in wartime\u2014the first such challenge the U.S. Navy has faced since the end of the Cold War. More broadly, these observers view China's naval capabilities as a key element of an emerging broader Chinese military challenge to the long-standing status of the United States as the leading military power in the Western Pacific.\nLonger Ship Deployments\nU.S. Navy officials have testified that fully meeting requests from U.S. regional combatant commanders (CCDRs) for forward-deployed U.S. naval forces would require a Navy much larger than today's fleet. For example, Navy officials testified in March 2014 that a Navy of 450 ships would be required to fully meet CCDR requests for forward-deployed Navy forces. CCDR requests for forward-deployed U.S. Navy forces are adjudicated by DOD through a process called the Global Force Management Allocation Plan. The process essentially makes choices about how best to apportion a finite number forward-deployed U.S. Navy ships among competing CCDR requests for those ships. Even with this process, the Navy has lengthened the deployments of some ships in an attempt to meet policymaker demands for forward-deployed U.S. Navy ships. Although Navy officials are aiming to limit ship deployments to seven months, Navy ships in recent years have frequently been deployed for periods of eight months or more.\nLimits on Defense Spending in Budget Control Act of 2011 as Amended\nLimits on the \"base\" portion of the U.S. defense budget established by Budget Control Act of 2011, or BCA ( S. 365 / P.L. 112-25 of August 2, 2011), as amended, combined with some of the considerations above, have led to discussions among observers about how to balance competing demands for finite U.S. defense funds, and about whether programs for responding to China's military modernization effort can be adequately funded while also adequately funding other defense-spending priorities, such as initiatives for responding to Russia's actions in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe and U.S. operations for countering the Islamic State organization in the Middle East.\nAppendix B. Earlier Navy Force-Structure Goals Dating Back to 2001\nThe table below shows earlier Navy force-structure goals dating back to 2001. The 308-ship force-level goal of March 2015, shown in the first column of the table, is the goal that was replaced by the 355-ship force-level goal released in December 2016.\nAppendix C. Comparing Past Ship Force Levels to Current or Potential Future Ship Force Levels\nIn assessing the appropriateness of the current or potential future number of ships in the Navy, observers sometimes compare that number to historical figures for total Navy fleet size. Historical figures for total fleet size, however, can be a problematic yardstick for assessing the appropriateness of the current or potential future number of ships in the Navy, particularly if the historical figures are more than a few years old, because\nthe missions to be performed by the Navy, the mix of ships that make up the Navy, and the technologies that are available to Navy ships for performing missions all change over time; and the number of ships in the fleet in an earlier year might itself have been inappropriate (i.e., not enough or more than enough) for meeting the Navy's mission requirements in that year.\nRegarding the first bullet point above, the Navy, for example, reached a late-Cold War peak of 568 battle force ships at the end of FY1987, and as of May 7, 2019, included a total of 289 battle force ships. The FY1987 fleet, however, was intended to meet a set of mission requirements that focused on countering Soviet naval forces at sea during a potential multitheater NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict, while the May 2019 fleet is intended to meet a considerably different set of mission requirements centered on influencing events ashore by countering both land- and sea-based military forces of China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, as well as nonstate terrorist organizations. In addition, the Navy of FY1987 differed substantially from the May 2019 fleet in areas such as profusion of precision-guided air-delivered weapons, numbers of Tomahawk-capable ships, and the sophistication of C4ISR systems and networking capabilities.\nIn coming years, Navy missions may shift again, and the capabilities of Navy ships will likely have changed further by that time due to developments such as more comprehensive implementation of networking technology, increased use of ship-based unmanned vehicles, and the potential fielding of new types of weapons such as lasers or electromagnetic rail guns.\nThe 568-ship fleet of FY1987 may or may not have been capable of performing its stated missions; the 289-ship fleet of May 2019 may or may not be capable of performing its stated missions; and a fleet years from now with a certain number of ships may or may not be capable of performing its stated missions. Given changes over time in mission requirements, ship mixes, and technologies, however, these three issues are to a substantial degree independent of one another.\nFor similar reasons, trends over time in the total number of ships in the Navy are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the direction of change in the fleet's ability to perform its stated missions. An increasing number of ships in the fleet might not necessarily mean that the fleet's ability to perform its stated missions is increasing, because the fleet's mission requirements might be increasing more rapidly than ship numbers and average ship capability. Similarly, a decreasing number of ships in the fleet might not necessarily mean that the fleet's ability to perform stated missions is decreasing, because the fleet's mission requirements might be declining more rapidly than numbers of ships, or because average ship capability and the percentage of time that ships are in deployed locations might be increasing quickly enough to more than offset reductions in total ship numbers.\nRegarding the second of the two bullet points above, it can be noted that comparisons of the size of the fleet today with the size of the fleet in earlier years rarely appear to consider whether the fleet was appropriately sized in those earlier years (and therefore potentially suitable as a yardstick of comparison), even though it is quite possible that the fleet in those earlier years might not have been appropriately sized, and even though there might have been differences of opinion among observers at that time regarding that question. Just as it might not be prudent for observers years from now to tacitly assume that the 286-ship Navy of September 2018 was appropriately sized for meeting the mission requirements of 2018, even though there were differences of opinion among observers on that question, simply because a figure of 286 ships appears in the historical records for 2016, so, too, might it not be prudent for observers today to tacitly assume that the number of ships of the Navy in an earlier year was appropriate for meeting the Navy's mission requirements that year, even though there might have been differences of opinion among observers at that time regarding that question, simply because the size of the Navy in that year appears in a table like Table H-1 .\nPrevious Navy force structure plans, such as those shown in Table B-1 , might provide some insight into the potential adequacy of a proposed new force-structure plan, but changes over time in mission requirements, technologies available to ships for performing missions, and other force-planning factors, as well as the possibility that earlier force-structure plans might not have been appropriate for meeting the mission demands of their times, suggest that some caution should be applied in using past force structure plans for this purpose, particularly if those past force structure plans are more than a few years old. The Reagan-era goal for a 600-ship Navy, for example, was designed for a Cold War set of missions focusing on countering Soviet naval forces at sea, which is not an appropriate basis for planning the Navy today, and there was considerable debate during those years as to the appropriateness of the 600-ship goal.\nAppendix D. Industrial Base Ability for, and Employment Impact of, Additional Shipbuilding Work\nThis appendix presents background information on the ability of the industrial base to take on the additional shipbuilding work associated with achieving and maintaining the Navy's 355-ship force-level goal and on the employment impact of additional shipbuilding work.\nIndustrial Base Ability\nThe U.S. shipbuilding industrial base has some unused capacity to take on increased Navy shipbuilding work, particularly for certain kinds of surface ships, and its capacity could be increased further over time to support higher Navy shipbuilding rates. Navy shipbuilding rates could not be increased steeply across the board overnight\u2014time (and investment) would be needed to hire and train additional workers and increase production facilities at shipyards and supplier firms, particularly for supporting higher rates of submarine production. Depending on their specialties, newly hired workers could be initially less productive per unit of time worked than more experienced workers.\nSome parts of the shipbuilding industrial base, such as the submarine construction industrial base, could face more challenges than others in ramping up to the higher production rates required to build the various parts of the 355-ship fleet. Over a period of a few to several years, with investment and management attention, Navy shipbuilding could ramp up to higher rates for achieving a 355-ship fleet over a period of 20-30 years.\nAn April 2017 CBO report stated that\nall seven shipyards [currently involved in building the Navy's major ships] would need to increase their workforces and several would need to make improvements to their infrastructure in order to build ships at a faster rate. However, certain sectors face greater obstacles in constructing ships at faster rates than others: Building more submarines to meet the goals of the 2016 force structure assessment would pose the greatest challenge to the shipbuilding industry. Increasing the number of aircraft carriers and surface combatants would pose a small to moderate challenge to builders of those vessels. Finally, building more amphibious ships and combat logistics and support ships would be the least problematic for the shipyards. The workforces across those yards would need to increase by about 40 percent over the next 5 to 10 years. Managing the growth and training of those new workforces while maintaining the current standard of quality and efficiency would represent the most significant industrywide challenge. In addition, industry and Navy sources indicate that as much as $4 billion would need to be invested in the physical infrastructure of the shipyards to achieve the higher production rates required under the [notional] 15-year and 20-year [buildup scenarios examined by CBO]. Less investment would be needed for the [notional] 25-year or 30-year [buildup scenarios examined by CBO].\nA January 13, 2017, press report states the following:\nThe Navy's production lines are hot and the work to prepare them for the possibility of building out a much larger fleet would be manageable, the service's head of acquisition said Thursday.\nFrom a logistics perspective, building the fleet from its current 274 ships to 355, as recommended in the Navy's newest force structure assessment in December, would be straightforward, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition Sean Stackley told reporters at the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium.\n\"By virtue of maintaining these hot production lines, frankly, over the last eight years, our facilities are in pretty good shape,\" Stackley said. \"In fact, if you talked to industry, they would say we're underutilizing the facilities that we have.\"\nThe areas where the Navy would likely have to adjust \"tooling\" to answer demand for a larger fleet would likely be in Virginia-class attack submarines and large surface combatants, the DDG-51 guided missile destroyers\u2014two ship classes likely to surge if the Navy gets funding to build to 355 ships, he said.\n\"Industry's going to have to go out and procure special tooling associated with going from current production rates to a higher rate, but I would say that's easily done,\" he said.\nAnother key, Stackley said, is maintaining skilled workers\u2014both the builders in the yards and the critical supply-chain vendors who provide major equipment needed for ship construction. And, he suggested, it would help to avoid budget cuts and other events that would force workforce layoffs.\n\"We're already prepared to ramp up,\" he said. \"In certain cases, that means not laying off the skilled workforce we want to retain.\"\nA January 17, 2017, press report states the following:\nBuilding stable designs with active production lines is central to the Navy's plan to grow to 355 ships. \"if you look at the 355-ship number, and you study the ship classes (desired), the big surge is in attack submarines and large surface combatants, which today are DDG-51 (destroyers),\" the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Sean Stackley, told reporters at last week's Surface Navy Association conference. Those programs have proven themselves reliable performers both at sea and in the shipyards.\nFrom today's fleet of 274 ships, \"we're on an irreversible path to 308 by 2021. Those ships are already in construction,\" said Stackley. \"To go from there to 355, virtually all those ships are currently in production, with some exceptions: Ohio Replacement, (we) just got done the Milestone B there (to move from R&D into detailed design); and then upgrades to existing platforms. So we have hot production lines that will take us to that 355-ship Navy.\"\nA January 24, 2017, press report states the following:\nNavy officials say a recently determined plan to increase its fleet size by adding more new submarines, carriers and destroyers is \"executable\" and that early conceptual work toward this end is already underway....\nAlthough various benchmarks will need to be reached in order for this new plan to come to fruition, such as Congressional budget allocations, Navy officials do tell Scout Warrior that the service is already working\u2014at least in concept\u2014on plans to vastly enlarge the fleet. Findings from this study are expected to inform an upcoming 2018 Navy Shipbuilding Plan, service officials said.\nA January 12, 2017, press report states the following:\nBrian Cuccias, president of Ingalls Shipbuilding [a shipyard owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) that builds Navy destroyers and amphibious ships as well as Coast Guard cutters], said Ingalls, which is currently building 10 ships for four Navy and Coast Guard programs at its 800-acre facility in Pascagoula, Miss., could build more because it is using only 70 to 75 percent of its capacity.\nA March 2017 press report states the following:\nAs the Navy calls for a larger fleet, shipbuilders are looking toward new contracts and ramping up their yards to full capacity....\nThe Navy is confident that U.S. shipbuilders will be able to meet an increased demand, said Ray Mabus, then-secretary of the Navy, during a speech at the Surface Navy Association's annual conference in Arlington, Virginia.\nThey have the capacity to \"get there because of the ships we are building today,\" Mabus said. \"I don't think we could have seven years ago.\"\nShipbuilders around the United States have \"hot\" production lines and are manufacturing vessels on multi-year or block buy contracts, he added. The yards have made investments in infrastructure and in the training of their workers.\n\"We now have the basis ... [to] get to that much larger fleet,\" he said....\nShipbuilders have said they are prepared for more work.\nAt Ingalls Shipbuilding\u2014a subsidiary of Huntington Ingalls Industries\u201410 ships are under construction at its Pascagoula, Mississippi, yard, but it is under capacity, said Brian Cuccias, the company's president.\nThe shipbuilder is currently constructing five guided-missile destroyers, the latest San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship, and two national security cutters for the Coast Guard.\n\"Ingalls is a very successful production line right now, but it has the ability to actually produce a lot more in the future,\" he said during a briefing with reporters in January.\nThe company's facility is currently operating at 75 percent capacity, he noted....\nAustal USA\u2014the builder of the Independence-variant of the littoral combat ship and the expeditionary fast transport vessel\u2014is also ready to increase its capacity should the Navy require it, said Craig Perciavalle, the company's president.\nThe latest discussions are \"certainly something that a shipbuilder wants to hear,\" he said. \"We do have the capability of increasing throughput if the need and demand were to arise, and then we also have the ability with the present workforce and facility to meet a different mix that could arise as well.\"\nAustal could build fewer expeditionary fast transport vessels and more littoral combat ships, or vice versa, he added.\n\"The key thing for us is to keep the manufacturing lines hot and really leverage the momentum that we've gained on both of the programs,\" he said.\nThe company\u2014which has a 164-acre yard in Mobile, Alabama\u2014is focused on the extension of the LCS and expeditionary fast transport ship program, but Perciavalle noted that it could look into manufacturing other types of vessels.\n\"We do have excess capacity to even build smaller vessels \u2026 if that opportunity were to arise and we're pursuing that,\" he said.\nBryan Clark, a naval analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said shipbuilders are on average running between 70 and 80 percent capacity. While they may be ready to meet an increased demand for ships, it would take time to ramp up their workforces.\nHowever, the bigger challenge is the supplier industrial base, he said.\n\"Shipyards may be able to build ships but the supplier base that builds the pumps \u2026 and the radars and the radios and all those other things, they don't necessarily have that ability to ramp up,\" he said. \"You would need to put some money into building up their capacity.\"\nThat has to happen now, he added.\nRear Adm. William Gallinis, program manager for program executive office ships, said what the Navy must be \"mindful of is probably our vendor base that support the shipyards.\"\nSmaller companies that supply power electronics and switchboards could be challenged, he said.\n\"Do we need to re-sequence some of the funding to provide some of the facility improvements for some of the vendors that may be challenged? My sense is that the industrial base will size to the demand signal. We just need to be mindful of how we transition to that increased demand signal,\" he said.\nThe acquisition workforce may also see an increased amount of stress, Gallinis noted. \"It takes a fair amount of experience and training to get a good contracting officer to the point to be [able to] manage contracts or procure contracts.\"\n\"But I don't see anything that is insurmountable,\" he added.\nAt a May 24, 2017, hearing before the Seapower subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the industrial-base aspects of the Navy's 355-ship goal, John P. Casey, executive vice president\u2013marine systems, General Dynamics Corporation (one of the country's two principal builders of Navy ships) stated the following:\nIt is our belief that the Nation's shipbuilding industrial base can scale-up hot production lines for existing ships and mobilize additional resources to accomplish the significant challenge of achieving the 355-ship Navy as quickly as possible....\nSupporting a plan to achieve a 355-ship Navy will be the most challenging for the nuclear submarine enterprise. Much of the shipyard and industrial base capacity was eliminated following the steep drop-off in submarine production that occurred with the cancellation of the Seawolf Program in 1992. The entire submarine industrial base at all levels of the supply chain will likely need to recapitalize some portion of its facilities, workforce, and supply chain just to support the current plan to build the Columbia Class SSBN program, while concurrently building Virginia Class SSNs. Additional SSN procurement will require industry to expand its plans and associated investment beyond the level today....\nShipyard labor resources include the skilled trades needed to fabricate, build and outfit major modules, perform assembly, test and launch of submarines, and associated support organizations that include planning, material procurement, inspection, quality assurance, and ship certification. Since there is no commercial equivalency for Naval nuclear submarine shipbuilding, these trade resources cannot be easily acquired in large numbers from other industries. Rather, these shipyard resources must be acquired and developed over time to ensure the unique knowledge and know-how associated with nuclear submarine shipbuilding is passed on to the next generation of shipbuilders. The mechanisms of knowledge transfer require sufficient lead time to create the proficient, skilled craftsmen in each key trade including welding, electrical, machining, shipfitting, pipe welding, painting, and carpentry, which are among the largest trades that would need to grow to support increased demand. These trades will need to be hired in the numbers required to support the increased workload. Both shipyards have scalable processes in place to acquire, train, and develop the skilled workforce they need to build nuclear ships. These processes and associated training facilities need to be expanded to support the increased demand. As with the shipyards, the same limiting factors associated with facilities, workforce, and supply chain also limit the submarine unique first tier suppliers and sub-tiers in the industrial base for which there is no commercial equivalency....\nThe supply base is the third resource that will need to be expanded to meet the increased demand over the next 20 years. During the OHIO, 688 and SEAWOLF construction programs, there were over 17,000 suppliers supporting submarine construction programs. That resource base was \"rationalized\" during submarine low rate production over the last 20 years. The current submarine industrial base reflects about 5,000 suppliers, of which about 3,000 are currently active (i.e., orders placed within the last 5 years), 80% of which are single or sole source (based on $). It will take roughly 20 years to build the 12 Columbia Class submarines that starts construction in FY21. The shipyards are expanding strategic sourcing of appropriate non-core products (e.g., decks, tanks, etc.) in order to focus on core work at each shipyard facility (e.g., module outfitting and assembly). Strategic sourcing will move demand into the supply base where capacity may exist or where it can be developed more easily. This approach could offer the potential for cost savings by competition or shifting work to lower cost work centers throughout the country. Each shipyard has a process to assess their current supply base capacity and capability and to determine where it would be most advantageous to perform work in the supply base....\nAchieving the increased rate of production and reducing the cost of submarines will require the Shipbuilders to rely on the supply base for more non-core products such as structural fabrication, sheet metal, machining, electrical, and standard parts. The supply base must be made ready to execute work with submarine-specific requirements at a rate and volume that they are not currently prepared to perform. Preparing the supply base to execute increased demand requires early non-recurring funding to support cross-program construction readiness and EOQ funding to procure material in a manner that does not hold up existing ship construction schedules should problems arise in supplier qualification programs. This requires longer lead times (estimates of three years to create a new qualified, critical supplier) than the current funding profile supports....\nWe need to rely on market principles to allow suppliers, the shipyards and GFE material providers to sort through the complicated demand equation across the multiple ship programs. Supplier development funding previously mentioned would support non-recurring efforts which are needed to place increased orders for material in multiple market spaces. Examples would include valves, build-to-print fabrication work, commodities, specialty material, engineering components, etc. We are engaging our marine industry associations to help foster innovative approaches that could reduce costs and gain efficiency for this increased volume....\nSupporting the 355-ship Navy will require Industry to add capability and capacity across the entire Navy Shipbuilding value chain. Industry will need to make investment decisions for additional capital spend starting now in order to meet a step change in demand that would begin in FY19 or FY20. For the submarine enterprise, the step change was already envisioned and investment plans that embraced a growth trajectory were already being formulated. Increasing demand by adding additional submarines will require scaling facility and workforce development plans to operate at a higher rate of production. The nuclear shipyards would also look to increase material procurement proportionally to the increased demand. In some cases, the shipyard facilities may be constrained with existing capacity and may look to source additional work in the supply base where capacity exists or where there are competitive business advantages to be realized. Creating additional capacity in the supply base will require non-recurring investment in supplier qualification, facilities, capital equipment and workforce training and development.\nIndustry is more likely to increase investment in new capability and capacity if there is certainty that the Navy will proceed with a stable shipbuilding plan. Positive signals of commitment from the Government must go beyond a published 30-year Navy Shipbuilding Plan and line items in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) and should include:\nMulti-year contracting for Block procurement which provides stability in the industrial base and encourages investment in facilities and workforce development Funding for supplier development to support training, qualification, and facilitization efforts\u2014Electric Boat and Newport News have recommended to the Navy funding of $400M over a three-year period starting in 2018 to support supplier development for the Submarine Industrial Base as part of an Integrated Enterprise Plan Extended Enterprise initiative Acceleration of Advance Procurement and/or Economic Order Quantities (EOQ) procurement from FY19 to FY18 for Virginia Block V Government incentives for construction readiness and facilities / special tooling for shipyard and supplier facilities, which help cash flow capital investment ahead of construction contract awards Procurement of additional production back-up (PBU) material to help ensure a ready supply of material to mitigate construction schedule risk....\nSo far, this testimony has focused on the Submarine Industrial Base, but the General Dynamics Marine Systems portfolio also includes surface ship construction. Unlike Electric Boat, Bath Iron Works and NASSCO are able to support increased demand without a significant increase in resources.....\nBath Iron Works is well positioned to support the Administration's announced goal of increasing the size of the Navy fleet to 355 ships. For BIW that would mean increasing the total current procurement rate of two DDG 51s per year to as many as four DDGs per year, allocated equally between BIW and HII. This is the same rate that the surface combatant industrial base sustained over the first decade of full rate production of the DDG 51 Class (1989-1999)....\nNo significant capital investment in new facilities is required to accommodate delivering two DDGs per year. However, additional funding will be required to train future shipbuilders and maintain equipment. Current hiring and training processes support the projected need, and have proven to be successful in the recent past. BIW has invested significantly in its training programs since 2014 with the restart of the DDG 51 program and given these investments and the current market in Maine, there is little concern of meeting the increase in resources required under the projected plans.\nA predictable and sustainable Navy workload is essential to justify expanding hiring/training programs. BIW would need the Navy's commitment that the Navy's plan will not change before it would proceed with additional hiring and training to support increased production.\nBIW's supply chain is prepared to support a procurement rate increase of up to four DDG 51s per year for the DDG 51 Program. BIW has long-term purchasing agreements in place for all major equipment and material for the DDG 51 Program. These agreements provide for material lead time and pricing, and are not constrained by the number of ships ordered in a year. BIW confirmed with all of its critical suppliers that they can support this increased procurement rate....\nThe Navy's Force Structure Assessment calls for three additional ESBs. Additionally, NASSCO has been asked by the Navy and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to evaluate its ability to increase the production rate of T-AOs to two ships per year. NASSCO has the capacity to build three more ESBs at a rate of one ship per year while building two T-AOs per year. The most cost effective funding profile requires funding ESB 6 in FY18 and the following ships in subsequent fiscal years to avoid increased cost resulting from a break in the production line. The most cost effective funding profile to enable a production rate of two T-AO ships per year requires funding an additional long lead time equipment set beginning in FY19 and an additional ship each year beginning in FY20.\nNASSCO must now reduce its employment levels due to completion of a series of commercial programs which resulted in the delivery of six ships in 2016. The proposed increase in Navy shipbuilding stabilizes NASSCO's workload and workforce to levels that were readily demonstrated over the last several years.\nSome moderate investment in the NASSCO shipyard will be needed to reach this level of production. The recent CBO report on the costs of building a 355-ship Navy accurately summarized NASSCO's ability to reach the above production rate stating, \"building more \u2026 combat logistics and support ships would be the least problematic for the shipyards.\"\nAt the same hearing, Brian Cuccias, president, Ingalls Shipbuilding, Huntington Ingalls Industries (the country's other principal builder of Navy ships) stated the following:\nQualifying to be a supplier is a difficult process. Depending on the commodity, it may take up to 36 months. That is a big burden on some of these small businesses. This is why creating sufficient volume and exercising early contractual authorization and advance procurement funding is necessary to grow the supplier base, and not just for traditional long-lead time components; that effort needs to expand to critical components and commodities that today are controlling the build rate of submarines and carriers alike. Many of our suppliers are small businesses and can only make decisions to invest in people, plant and tooling when they are awarded a purchase order. We need to consider how we can make commitments to suppliers early enough to ensure material readiness and availability when construction schedules demand it.\nWith questions about the industry's ability to support an increase in shipbuilding, both Newport News and Ingalls have undertaken an extensive inventory of our suppliers and assessed their ability to ramp up their capacity. We have engaged many of our key suppliers to assess their ability to respond to an increase in production.\nThe fortunes of related industries also impact our suppliers, and an increase in demand from the oil and gas industry may stretch our supply base. Although some low to moderate risk remains, I am convinced that our suppliers will be able to meet the forecasted Navy demand....\nI strongly believe that the fastest results can come from leveraging successful platforms on current hot production lines. We commend the Navy's decision in 2014 to use the existing LPD 17 hull form for the LX(R), which will replace the LSD-class amphibious dock landing ships scheduled to retire in the coming years. However, we also recommend that the concept of commonality be taken even further to best optimize efficiency, affordability and capability. Specifically, rather than continuing with a new design for LX(R) within the \"walls\" of the LPD hull, we can leverage our hot production line and supply chain and offer the Navy a variant of the existing LPD design that satisfies the aggressive cost targets of the LX(R) program while delivering more capability and survivability to the fleet at a significantly faster pace than the current program. As much as 10-15 percent material savings can be realized across the LX(R) program by purchasing respective blocks of at least five ships each under a multi-year procurement (MYP) approach. In the aggregate, continuing production with LPD 30 in FY18, coupled with successive MYP contracts for the balance of ships, may yield savings greater than $1 billion across an 11-ship LX(R) program. Additionally, we can deliver five LX(R)s to the Navy and Marine Corps in the same timeframe that the current plan would deliver two, helping to reduce the shortfall in amphibious warships against the stated force requirement of 38 ships.\nMulti-ship procurements, whether a formal MYP or a block-buy, are a proven way to reduce the price of ships. The Navy took advantage of these tools on both Virginia-class submarines and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. In addition to the LX(R) program mentioned above, expanding multi-ship procurements to other ship classes makes sense....\nThe most efficient approach to lower the cost of the Ford class and meet the goal of an increased CVN fleet size is also to employ a multi-ship procurement strategy and construct these ships at three-year intervals. This approach would maximize the material procurement savings benefit through economic order quantities procurement and provide labor efficiencies to enable rapid acquisition of a 12-ship CVN fleet. This three-ship approach would save at least $1.5 billion, not including additional savings that could be achieved from government-furnished equipment. As part of its Integrated Enterprise Plan, we commend the Navy's efforts to explore the prospect of material economic order quantity purchasing across carrier and submarine programs.\nAt the same hearing, Matthew O. Paxton, president, Shipbuilders Council of America (SCA)\u2014a trade association representing shipbuilders, suppliers, and associated firms\u2014stated the following:\nTo increase the Navy's Fleet to 355 ships, a substantial and sustained investment is required in both procurement and readiness. However, let me be clear: building and sustaining the larger required Fleet is achievable and our industry stands ready to help achieve that important national security objective.\nTo meet the demand for increased vessel construction while sustaining the vessels we currently have will require U.S. shipyards to expand their work forces and improve their infrastructure in varying degrees depending on ship type and ship mix \u2013 a requirement our Nation's shipyards are eager to meet. But first, in order to build these ships in as timely and affordable manner as possible, stable and robust funding is necessary to sustain those industrial capabilities which support Navy shipbuilding and ship maintenance and modernization....\nBeyond providing for the building of a 355-ship Navy, there must also be provision to fund the \"tail,\" the maintenance of the current and new ships entering the fleet. Target fleet size cannot be reached if existing ships are not maintained to their full service lives, while building those new ships. Maintenance has been deferred in the last few years because of across-the-board budget cuts....\nThe domestic shipyard industry certainly has the capability and know-how to build and maintain a 355-ship Navy. The Maritime Administration determined in a recent study on the Economic Benefits of the U.S. Shipyard Industry that there are nearly 110,000 skilled men and women in the Nation's private shipyards building, repairing and maintaining America's military and commercial fleets.1 The report found the U.S. shipbuilding industry supports nearly 400,000 jobs across the country and generates $25.1 billion in income and $37.3 billion worth of goods and services each year. In fact, the MARAD report found that the shipyard industry creates direct and induced employment in every State and Congressional District and each job in the private shipbuilding and repairing industry supports another 2.6 jobs nationally.\nThis data confirms the significant economic impact of this manufacturing sector, but also that the skilled workforce and industrial base exists domestically to build these ships. Long-term, there needs to be a workforce expansion and some shipyards will need to reconfigure or expand production lines. This can and will be done as required to meet the need if adequate, stable budgets and procurement plans are established and sustained for the long-term. Funding predictability and sustainability will allow industry to invest in facilities and more effectively grow its skilled workforce. The development of that critical workforce will take time and a concerted effort in a partnership between industry and the federal government.\nU.S. shipyards pride themselves on implementing state of the art training and apprenticeship programs to develop skilled men and women that can cut, weld, and bend steel and aluminum and who can design, build and maintain the best Navy in the world. However, the shipbuilding industry, like so many other manufacturing sectors, faces an aging workforce. Attracting and retaining the next generation shipyard worker for an industry career is critical. Working together with the Navy, and local and state resources, our association is committed to building a robust training and development pipeline for skilled shipyard workers. In addition to repealing sequestration and stabilizing funding the continued development of a skilled workforce also needs to be included in our national maritime strategy....\nIn conclusion, the U.S. shipyard industry is certainly up to the task of building a 355-ship Navy and has the expertise, the capability, the critical capacity and the unmatched skilled workforce to build these national assets. Meeting the Navy's goal of a 355-ship fleet and securing America's naval dominance for the decades ahead will require sustained investment by Congress and Navy's partnership with a defense industrial base that can further attract and retain a highly-skilled workforce with critical skill sets. Again, I would like to thank this Subcommittee for inviting me to testify alongside such distinguished witnesses. As a representative of our nation's private shipyards, I can say, with confidence and certainty, that our domestic shipyards and skilled workers are ready, willing and able to build and maintain the Navy's 355-ship Fleet.\nEmployment Impact\nBuilding the additional ships that would be needed to achieve and maintain the 355-ship fleet could create many additional manufacturing and other jobs at shipyards, associated supplier firms, and elsewhere in the U.S. economy. A 2015 Maritime Administration (MARAD) report states,\nConsidering the indirect and induced impacts, each direct job in the shipbuilding and repairing industry is associated with another 2.6 jobs in other parts of the US economy; each dollar of direct labor income and GDP in the shipbuilding and repairing industry is associated with another $1.74 in labor income and $2.49 in GDP, respectively, in other parts of the US economy.\nA March 2017 press report states, \"Based on a 2015 economic impact study, the Shipbuilders Council of America [a trade association for U.S. shipbuilders and associated supplier firms] believes that a 355-ship Navy could add more than 50,000 jobs nationwide.\" The 2015 economic impact study referred to in that quote might be the 2015 MARAD study discussed in the previous paragraph. An estimate of more than 50,000 additional jobs nationwide might be viewed as a higher-end estimate; other estimates might be lower. A June 14, 2017, press report states the following: \"The shipbuilding industry will need to add between 18,000 and 25,000 jobs to build to a 350-ship Navy, according to Matthew Paxton, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America, a trade association representing the shipbuilding industrial base. Including indirect jobs like suppliers, the ramp-up may require a boost of 50,000 workers.\"\nAppendix E. A Summary of Some Acquisition Lessons Learned for Navy Shipbuilding\nThis appendix presents a general summary of lessons learned in Navy shipbuilding, reflecting comments made repeatedly by various sources over the years. These lessons learned include the following:\nAt the outset, get the operational requirements for the program right. Properly identify the program's operational requirements at the outset. Manage risk by not trying to do too much in terms of the program's operational requirements, and perhaps seek a so-called 70%-to-80% solution (i.e., a design that is intended to provide 70%-80% of desired or ideal capabilities). Achieve a realistic balance up front between operational requirements, risks, and estimated costs. Impose cost discipline up front. Use realistic price estimates, and consider not only development and procurement costs, but life-cycle operation and support (O&S) costs. Employ competition where possible in the awarding of design and construction contracts. Use a contract type that is appropriate for the amount of risk involved , and structure its terms to align incentives with desired outcomes. Minimize design/construction concurrency by developing the design to a high level of completion before starting construction and by resisting changes in requirements (and consequent design changes) during construction. Properly supervise construction work. Maintain an adequate number of properly trained Supervisor of Shipbuilding (SUPSHIP) personnel. Provide stability for industry , in part by using, where possible, multiyear procurement (MYP) or block buy contracting. Maintain a capable government acquisition workforce that understands what it is buying, as well as the above points.\nIdentifying these lessons is arguably not the hard part\u2014most if not all these points have been cited for years. The hard part, arguably, is living up to them without letting circumstances lead program-execution efforts away from these guidelines.\nAppendix F. Some Considerations Relating to Warranties in Shipbuilding and Other Defense Acquisition\nThis appendix presents some considerations relating to warranties in shipbuilding and other defense acquisition.\nIn discussions of Navy (and also Coast Guard) shipbuilding, one question that sometimes arises is whether including a warranty in a shipbuilding contract is preferable to not including one. The question can arise, for example, in connection with a GAO finding that \"the Navy structures shipbuilding contracts so that it pays shipbuilders to build ships as part of the construction process and then pays the same shipbuilders a second time to repair the ship when construction defects are discovered.\"\nIncluding a warranty in a shipbuilding contract (or a contract for building some other kind of defense end item), while potentially valuable, might not always be preferable to not including one\u2014it depends on the circumstances of the acquisition, and it is not necessarily a valid criticism of an acquisition program to state that it is using a contract that does not include a warranty (or a weaker form of a warranty rather than a stronger one).\nIncluding a warranty generally shifts to the contractor the risk of having to pay for fixing problems with earlier work. Although that in itself could be deemed desirable from the government's standpoint, a contractor negotiating a contract that will have a warranty will incorporate that risk into its price, and depending on how much the contractor might charge for doing that, it is possible that the government could wind up paying more in total for acquiring the item (including fixing problems with earlier work on that item) than it would have under a contract without a warranty.\nWhen a warranty is not included in the contract and the government pays later on to fix problems with earlier work, those payments can be very visible, which can invite critical comments from observers. But that does not mean that including a warranty in the contract somehow frees the government from paying to fix problems with earlier work. In a contract that includes a warranty, the government will indeed pay something to fix problems with earlier work\u2014but it will make the payment in the less-visible (but still very real) form of the up-front charge for including the warranty, and that charge might be more than what it would have cost the government, under a contract without a warranty, to pay later on for fixing those problems.\nFrom a cost standpoint, including a warranty in the contract might or might not be preferable, depending on the risk that there will be problems with earlier work that need fixing, the potential cost of fixing such problems, and the cost of including the warranty in the contract. The point is that the goal of avoiding highly visible payments for fixing problems with earlier work and the goal of minimizing the cost to the government of fixing problems with earlier work are separate and different goals, and that pursuing the first goal can sometimes work against achieving the second goal.\nThe Department of Defense's guide on the use of warranties states the following:\nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 46.7 states that \"the use of warranties is not mandatory.\" However, if the benefits to be derived from the warranty are commensurate with the cost of the warranty, the CO [contracting officer] should consider placing it in the contract. In determining whether a warranty is appropriate for a specific acquisition, FAR Subpart 46.703 requires the CO to consider the nature and use of the supplies and services, the cost, the administration and enforcement, trade practices, and reduced requirements. The rationale for using a warranty should be documented in the contract file....\nIn determining the value of a warranty, a CBA [cost-benefit analysis] is used to measure the life cycle costs of the system with and without the warranty. A CBA is required to determine if the warranty will be cost beneficial. CBA is an economic analysis, which basically compares the Life Cycle Costs (LCC) of the system with and without the warranty to determine if warranty coverage will improve the LCCs. In general, five key factors will drive the results of the CBA: cost of the warranty + cost of warranty administration + compatibility with total program efforts + cost of overlap with Contractor support + intangible savings. Effective warranties integrate reliability, maintainability, supportability, availability, and life-cycle costs. Decision factors that must be evaluated include the state of the weapon system technology, the size of the warranted population, the likelihood that field performance requirements can be achieved, and the warranty period of performance.\nAppendix G. Some Considerations Relating to Avoiding Procurement Cost Growth vs. Minimizing Procurement Costs\nThis appendix presents some considerations relating to avoiding procurement cost growth vs. minimizing procurement costs in shipbuilding and other defense acquisition.\nThe affordability challenge posed by the Navy's shipbuilding plans can reinforce the strong oversight focus on preventing or minimizing procurement cost growth in Navy shipbuilding programs, which is one expression of a strong oversight focus on preventing or minimizing cost growth in DOD acquisition programs in general. This oversight focus may reflect in part an assumption that avoiding or minimizing procurement cost growth is always synonymous with minimizing procurement cost. It is important to note, however, that as paradoxical as it may seem, avoiding or minimizing procurement cost growth is not always synonymous with minimizing procurement cost, and that a sustained, singular focus on avoiding or minimizing procurement cost growth might sometimes lead to higher procurement costs for the government.\nHow could this be? Consider the example of a design for the lead ship of a new class of Navy ships. The construction cost of this new design is uncertain, but is estimated to be likely somewhere between Point A (a minimum possible figure) and Point D (a maximum possible figure). (Point D, in other words, would represent a cost estimate with a 100% confidence factor, meaning there is a 100% chance that the cost would come in at or below that level.) If the Navy wanted to avoid cost growth on this ship, it could simply set the ship's procurement cost at Point D. Industry would likely be happy with this arrangement, and there likely would be no cost growth on the ship.\nThe alternative strategy open to the Navy is to set the ship's target procurement cost at some figure between Points A and D\u2014call it Point B\u2014and then use that more challenging target cost to place pressure on industry to sharpen its pencils so as to find ways to produce the ship at that lower cost. (Navy officials sometimes refer to this as \"pressurizing\" industry.) In this example, it might turn out that industry efforts to reduce production costs are not successful enough to build the ship at the Point B cost. As a result, the ship experiences one or more rounds of procurement cost growth, and the ship's procurement cost rises over time from Point B to some higher figure\u2014call it Point C.\nHere is the rub: Point C, in spite of incorporating one or more rounds of cost growth, might nevertheless turn out to be lower than Point D, because Point C reflected efforts by the shipbuilder to find ways to reduce production costs that the shipbuilder might have put less energy into pursuing if the Navy had simply set the ship's procurement cost initially at Point D.\nSetting the ship's cost at Point D, in other words, may eliminate the risk of cost growth on the ship, but does so at the expense of creating a risk of the government paying more for the ship than was actually necessary. DOD could avoid cost growth on new procurement programs starting tomorrow by simply setting costs for those programs at each program's equivalent of Point D. But as a result of this strategy, DOD could well wind up leaving money on the table in some instances\u2014of not, in other words, minimizing procurement costs.\nDOD does not have to set a cost precisely at Point D to create a potential risk in this regard. A risk of leaving money on the table, for example, is a possible downside of requiring DOD to budget for its acquisition programs at something like an 80% confidence factor\u2014an approach that some observers have recommended\u2014because a cost at the 80% confidence factor is a cost that is likely fairly close to Point D.\nProcurement cost growth is often embarrassing for DOD and industry, and can damage their credibility in connection with future procurement efforts. Procurement cost growth can also disrupt congressional budgeting by requiring additional appropriations to pay for something Congress thought it had fully funded in a prior year. For this reason, there is a legitimate public policy value to pursuing a goal of having less rather than more procurement cost growth.\nProcurement cost growth, however, can sometimes be in part the result of DOD efforts to use lower initial cost targets as a means of pressuring industry to reduce production costs\u2014efforts that, notwithstanding the cost growth, might be partially successful. A sustained, singular focus on avoiding or minimizing cost growth, and of punishing DOD for all instances of cost growth, could discourage DOD from using lower initial cost targets as a means of pressurizing industry, which could deprive DOD of a tool for controlling procurement costs.\nThe point here is not to excuse away cost growth, because cost growth can occur in a program for reasons other than DOD's attempt to pressurize industry. Nor is the point to abandon the goal of seeking lower rather than higher procurement cost growth, because, as noted above, there is a legitimate public policy value in pursuing this goal. The point, rather, is to recognize that this goal is not always synonymous with minimizing procurement cost, and that a possibility of some amount of cost growth might be expected as part of an optimal government strategy for minimizing procurement cost. Recognizing that the goals of seeking lower rather than higher cost growth and of minimizing procurement cost can sometimes be in tension with one another can lead to an approach that takes both goals into consideration. In contrast, an approach that is instead characterized by a sustained, singular focus on avoiding and minimizing cost growth may appear virtuous, but in the end may wind up costing the government more.\nAppendix H. Size of the Navy and Navy Shipbuilding Rate\nSize of the Navy\n Table H-1 shows the size of the Navy in terms of total number of ships since FY1948; the numbers shown in the table reflect changes over time in the rules specifying which ships count toward the total. Differing counting rules result in differing totals, and for certain years, figures reflecting more than one set of counting rules are available. Figures in the table for FY1978 and subsequent years reflect the battle force ships counting method, which is the set of counting rules established in the early 1980s for public policy discussions of the size of the Navy.\nAs shown in the table, the total number of battle force ships in the Navy reached a late-Cold War peak of 568 at the end of FY1987 and began declining thereafter. The Navy fell below 300 battle force ships in August 2003 and as of April 26, 2019, included 289 battle force ships.\nAs discussed in Appendix C , historical figures for total fleet size might not be a reliable yardstick for assessing the appropriateness of proposals for the future size and structure of the Navy, particularly if the historical figures are more than a few years old, because the missions to be performed by the Navy, the mix of ships that make up the Navy, and the technologies that are available to Navy ships for performing missions all change over time, and because the number of ships in the fleet in an earlier year might itself have been inappropriate (i.e., not enough or more than enough) for meeting the Navy's mission requirements in that year.\nFor similar reasons, trends over time in the total number of ships in the Navy are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the direction of change in the fleet's ability to perform its stated missions. An increasing number of ships in the fleet might not necessarily mean that the fleet's ability to perform its stated missions is increasing, because the fleet's mission requirements might be increasing more rapidly than ship numbers and average ship capability. Similarly, a decreasing number of ships in the fleet might not necessarily mean that the fleet's ability to perform stated missions is decreasing, because the fleet's mission requirements might be declining more rapidly than numbers of ships, or because average ship capability and the percentage of time that ships are in deployed locations might be increasing quickly enough to more than offset reductions in total ship numbers.\nShipbuilding Rate\n Table H-2 shows past (FY1982-FY2019) and requested or programmed (FY2020-FY2024) rates of Navy ship procurement.\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "The current and planned size and composition of the Navy, the rate of Navy ship procurement, and the prospective affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plans have been oversight matters for the congressional defense committees for many years.\nOn December 15, 2016, the Navy released a force-structure goal that calls for achieving and maintaining a fleet of 355 ships of certain types and numbers. The 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. The Navy states that a new FSA is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA. This new FSA, Navy officials state, is to be completed by the end of 2019. Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both.\nThe Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2024) shipbuilding plan includes 55 new ships, or an average of 11 new ships per year.\nThe Navy's FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) shipbuilding plan includes 304 ships, or an average of about 10 per year. If the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan is implemented, the Navy projects that it will achieve a total of 355 ships by FY2034. This is about 20 years sooner than projected under the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan\u2014an acceleration primarily due to a decision announced by the Navy in April 2018, after the FY2019 plan was submitted, to increase the service lives of all DDG-51 destroyers to 45 years. Although the Navy projects that the fleet will reach a total of 355 ships in FY2034, the Navy in that year and subsequent years will not match the composition called for in the FY2016 FSA.\nOne issue for Congress is whether the new FSA that the Navy is conducting will change the 355-ship force-level objective established by the 2016 FSA and, if so, in what ways. Another oversight issue for Congress concerns the prospective affordability of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan. Decisions that Congress makes regarding Navy force structure and shipbuilding plans can substantially affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base.",

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nIntroduction\n\nThis report provides background information and potential issues for Congress on the Navy's irregular warfare (IW) and counterterrorism (CT) operations. The Navy's IW and CT activities pose a number of potential oversight issues for Congress, including how much emphasis to place on IW and CT activities in Navy budgets, particularly in a context of constraints on Navy budgets and Navy desires to devote resources to developing \"high end\" combat capabilities for countering improved conventional military capabilities of countries such as China and Russia. Congress's decisions regarding Navy IW and CT operations can affect Navy operations and funding requirements, and the implementation of the nation's overall IW and CT strategies.\nThis report focuses on Navy IW and CT operations. Another CRS report discusses U.S. special operations forces (SOF) across the military services.\nFor an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which Navy IW and CT operations may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\t\tNavy Irregular Warfare (IW) Operations\n\n\t\t\tNote on Terminology\n\nThe Navy has sometimes used the phrase confronting irregular challenges (CIC) instead of the term irregular warfare. For purposes of convenience, this report continues to use the term irregular warfare and the abbreviation IW.\n\n\t\t\tNavy IW Operations in Middle East and Afghanistan\n\nIn the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Navy carried out a variety of irregular warfare (IW) and counterterrorism (CT) activities. Among the most readily visible of these were operations carried out by Navy sailors serving ashore in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Regarding current operations in the Middle East, the Department of the Navy (DON) states the following in its FY2020 budget highlights book:\nThe Marine Corps has an active duty force of approximately 1,300 Marines ashore in the U.S. CENTCOM area of operations (AOR) and another roughly 850 Marine Reserve members supporting CENTCOM. Beyond the Marines participating in counterinsurgency, security cooperation, and civil-military operations; on any given day there are about 1,000 Sailors ashore and another roughly 6,500 afloat throughout the CENTCOM AOR. These sailors are conducting activities such as air operations, maritime infrastructure protection, combat construction engineering, cargo handling, combat logistics, maritime security, detainee operations, customs inspections, civil affairs, base operations, and other forward presence activities.\n\n\t\t\tNavy IW Operations Elsewhere\n\nIn addition to participating in U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan, Navy IW operations in the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2011, have also included the following:\nsecurity force assistance operations , in which forward-deployed Navy ships have exercised and worked with foreign navies, coast guards, and maritime police forces, so as to improve their abilities to conduct maritime security operations; civic assistance operations , in which forward-deployed Navy units, including Navy hospital ships, expeditionary medical teams, fleet surgical teams, and naval construction units have provided medical and construction services in foreign countries as a complement to other U.S. diplomatic and development activities in those countries; disaster relief operations , of which Navy forces have performed several in recent years; and counter-piracy operations , particularly off the Horn of Africa.\nDON states in its FY2020 budget highlights book that\nIn the past year, the Marine Corps executed 170 operations, eight amphibious operations, 115 theater security cooperation events and participated in 51 exercises and relief operations for Hurricanes Maria, Florence, and Michael. Within the context of these efforts, Amphibious Ready Groups / Marine Expeditionary Units (ARG/MEU) supported Combatant commands along-side regional partners providing a range of deliberate and crisis response options. Major exercises were held in Romania, Israel, Jordan, Malaysia, and off the coast of Djibouti. The Marine Corps also participated in theater security cooperation (TSC) exercises held in Brazil, Latvia, Jordan, Mexico, and Philippines that enhanced military cooperation, capability, and interoperability with partner nations while sustaining a ready, forward presence in support of the Combatant Commander requirements\u2026.\nThe Navy has active and reserve forces continually deployed in support of contingency operations overseas serving as members of Carrier Strike Groups, Expeditionary Strike Groups, Special Operating Forces, Seabee units, Marine forces, and medical units; some also serve as Individual Augmentees (IAs).\n\n\t\t\tNavy Individual Augmentees (IAs)\n\nSome of the Navy's contributions to IW operations around the world in the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, were made by Navy individual augmentees (IAs)\u2014individual Navy sailors assigned to various DOD operations. DON stated in 2014 that\nNavy IAs are providing combat support and combat service support for Army and Marine Corps personnel in Afghanistan. As IAs they are fulfilling vital roles by serving in traditional Navy roles such as USMC support, maritime and port security, cargo handling, airlift support, Seabee units, and as a member of joint task force/Combatant Commanders staffs. Non-traditional roles include detainee operations, custom inspections teams, and civil affairs.\n\n\t\tNavy Counterterrorism (CT) Operations\n\n\t\t\tIn General\n\nNavy CT operations (and anti-terrorism/force protection activities) at various points since the late 1990s, and particularly in the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, have included the following:\nOperations by Navy special operations forces, known as SEALs (an acronym standing for Sea, Air, and Land), that have been directed against terrorists; Tomahawk cruise missile attacks on suspected terrorist training camps and facilities, such as those reportedly conducted in Somalia on March 3 and May 1, 2008, and those conducted in 1998 in response to the 1998 terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa; surveillance by Navy ships and aircraft of suspected terrorists overseas; maritime intercept operations (MIO) that were aimed at identifying and intercepting terrorists or weapons of mass destruction at sea, or potentially threatening ships or aircraft that are in or approaching U.S. territorial waters\u2014an activity that has included Navy participation in the multilateral Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI); protection of forward-deployed Navy ships, an activity that was intensified following the terrorist attack on the Navy Aegis destroyer Cole (DDG-67) in October 2000 in the port of Aden, Yemen; protection of domestic and overseas Navy bases and facilities; working with the Coast Guard to build maritime domain awareness (or MDA, meaning a real-time understanding of activities on the world's oceans), and engaging with the U.S. Coast Guard to use the National Strategy for Maritime Security to more rapidly develop capabilities for Homeland Security, particularly in the area of MDA; assisting the Coast Guard in port-security operations; developing Global Maritime Intelligence Integration (GMII) as part of Joint Force Maritime Component Command (JFMCC) and Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA); and operations by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), for which combating terrorism is a core mission area.\nDON stated in 2014 that\nWhile forward, acting as the lead element of our defense-in-depth, naval forces will be positioned for increased roles in combating terrorism.... Expanded Maritime Interdiction Operations are authorized by the President and directed by the Secretary of Defense to intercept vessels identified to be transporting terrorists and/or terrorist-related materiel that poses an imminent threat to the United States and its allies.....\nWe have done small, precise attacks against terrorist cells and missile attacks against extremist sanctuaries.\nDON stated in 2013 that\nOur defense efforts are aimed at countering violent extremists and destabilizing threats, as well as upholding our commitments to allies and partner states. These armed adversaries such as terrorists, insurgents, and separatist militias are a principal challenge to U.S. interests in East Africa.\nAn April 8, 2013, press report about U.S. counterterrorism operations stated, regarding one particular operation, that\nThe uncertainties were evident nine months into Mr. Obama's first term, when intelligence agencies tracked down Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a suspect in the attacks on two American embassies in East Africa in 1998.\nThe original plan had been to fire long-range missiles to hit Mr. Nabhan and others as they drove in a convoy from Mogadishu, Somalia, to the seaside town of Baraawe. But that plan was scrubbed at the last minute, and instead a Navy SEALs team helicoptered from a ship and strafed Mr. Nabhan's convoy, killing him and three others. The SEALs landed to collect DNA samples to confirm the identities of the dead.\n\n\t\t\tMay 1-2, 2011, U.S. Military Operation That Killed Osama Bin Laden\n\nThe May 1-2, 2011, U.S. military operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed Osama bin Laden\u2014reportedly called Operation Neptune's Spear\u2014reportedly was carried out by a team of 23 Navy special operations forces, known as SEALs (an acronym standing for Sea, Air, and Land). The SEALs reportedly belonged to an elite unit known unofficially as Seal Team 6 and officially as the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU). The SEALs reportedly were flown to and from Abbottabad by Army special operations helicopters. Bin Laden's body reportedly was flown by a U.S. military helicopter from Abbottabad to a base in Afghanistan, and from there by a Marine Corps V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft to the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson (CVN-70), which was operating at the time in the Northern Arabian Sea. A few hours later, bin Laden's body reportedly was buried at sea from the ship. Differing accounts have been published regarding certain details of the operation.\nPress reports in July 2010 stated that U.S. forces in Afghanistan included at that time a special unit called Task Force 373, composed of Navy SEALs and Army Delta Force personnel, whose mission is \"the deactivation of top Taliban and terrorists by either killing or capturing them.\" \nA July 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report and a separate CRS report provide additional background information on the SEALs. Another CRS report provides further discussion of the operation that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\n\t\t\tDetention of Terrorist Suspects on U.S. Navy Ships\n\nAn August 16, 2015, press report stated the following:\nAfter a suspected militant was captured last year to face charges for the deadly 2012 attacks on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, he was brought to the U.S. aboard a Navy transport ship on a 13-day trip that his lawyers say could have taken 13 hours by plane.\nAhmed Abu Khattala faced days of questioning aboard the USS New York from separate teams of American interrogators, part of a two-step process designed to obtain both national security intelligence and evidence usable in a criminal prosecution.\nThe case, still in its early stages, is focusing attention on an interrogation strategy that the Obama administration has used in just a few recent terrorism investigations and prosecutions. Abu Khattala's lawyers already have signaled a challenge to the process, setting the stage for a rare court clash over a tactic that has riled civil liberties groups but is seen by the government as a vital and appropriate tool in prosecuting suspected terrorists captured overseas.\n\"I think they view it as important to show that terrorists can be prosecuted in U.S. courts, and this is an attempt to find a compromise between using people they capture as intelligence assets and prosecuting them in U.S. courts,\" said David Deitch, a former Justice Department terrorism prosecutor. \"It's a very hard balance to strike\u2014and may not be possible.\"\nThe administration has turned to questioning in international waters as an alternative to past practices in which suspects were sent to the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or secret CIA prisons. The process ordinarily begins with questioning from a specialized team of interrogators who collect intelligence that can inform government decisions, such as for drone strikes, but cannot be used in court. Then a team of FBI investigators starts from scratch, advising the detainee of his Miranda rights, such as the right to remain silent, and gathering statements that prosecutors can present as evidence in a trial.\nSome legal experts expect the hybrid interrogation technique to survive legal challenges. But defense lawyers are concerned that such prolonged detention can be used to wrangle a confession or amounts to an end-run around the government's obligation to promptly place a suspect before a judge.\n\"Basically by holding the suspects on a ship and delaying their presentment in federal court, they're able to get a leg up in interrogations,\" said Seton Hall University law professor Jonathan Hafetz, who has handled terrorism cases.\nAbu Khattala is facing charges in Washington in the Sept. 11-12, 2012, attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Following his June 2014 capture in Libya by U.S. special forces, he was placed aboard a Navy ship that his lawyers say made its way to the U.S. as slowly as possible to allow maximum time for interrogation. They say Abu Khattala was questioned for days by representatives from the High Value Detainee Interrogation Group, then for another stretch by FBI agents....\nOne early point of contention in the court case is the onboard interrogation. Abu Khattala's lawyers submitted court filings this month contending that the government held him \"captive on a military ship\u2014without the protection of and in spite of constitutional guarantees\u2014for the explicit purpose of illegally interrogating him for almost two weeks.\"\nFederal prosecutors have yet to respond.\nWhatever a judge decides, the case taps into a broader legal debate about the prosecution of terrorist suspects and presents a rare opportunity for a possible ruling on the admissibility of statements gathered aboard a military vessel.\nFor additional background information on detention of terrorist suspects on U.S. Navy ships, see Appendix E .\n\n\t\tNavy Initiatives to Improve Its IW and CT Capabilities\n\nIn the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Navy took certain actions intended to improve its IW and CT capabilities and activities, including those discussed below. Some of the actions the Navy took during those years are described briefly below.\n\n\t\t\tNavy Irregular Warfare Office (NIWO)/Navy Warfare Group (NWG)\n\nThe Navy in July 2008 established the Navy Irregular Warfare Office (NIWO) so as to \"institutionalize current ad hoc efforts in IW missions of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency and the supporting missions of information operations, intelligence operations, foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare as they apply to [CT] and [counterinsurgency].\"\nIn January 2013, the Navy directed the establishment of a Navy Warfare Group (NWG) \"to provide a dedicated organization to systematically evaluate, develop, and implement new strategic concepts deemed useful to the service....\" NIWO was disbanded, and its responsibilities were transferred to NWG, which is to \"[s]erve as the Navy lead for irregular warfare (IW) to incorporate IW into Navy capstone documents and to inform the PPBE [Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution] process.\"\n\n\t\t\t2010 Navy Vision Statement for Countering Irregular Challenges\n\nThe Navy in January 2010 published a vision statement for countering irregular challenges, which stated the following in part:\nThe U.S. Navy will meet irregular challenges through a flexible, agile, and broad array of multi-mission capabilities. We will emphasize Cooperative Security as part of a comprehensive government approach to mitigate the causes of insecurity and instability. We will operate in and from the maritime domain with joint and international partners to enhance regional security and stability, and to dissuade, deter, and when necessary, defeat irregular forces.\nThe full text of the vision statement is reproduced in Appendix C .\n\n\t\t\tNavy Community of Interest (COI) for Countering Irregular Challenges\n\nThe Navy in December 2010 established \"a community of interest [COI] to develop and advance ideas, collaboration and advocacy related to confronting irregular challenges (CIC).\"\n\n\t\t\tNavy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC)\n\nThe Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), headquartered at Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, VA, was established informally in October 2005 and formally on January 13, 2006. NECC consolidated and facilitated the expansion of a number of Navy organizations that have a role in IW operations. DON stated in 2014 that\nNavy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) is a global force provider of expeditionary combat service support and force protection capabilities to joint warfighting commanders. It is responsible for centrally managing the current and future readiness, resources, manning, training and equipping of a scalable, self-sustaining, integrated expeditionary force of active and reserve sailors. Expeditionary sailors are deployed from around the globe, supporting contingency operations and Combatant Commanders' Theater Security Cooperation Plans, providing a forward presence of waterborne and ashore anti-terrorism force protection; theater security cooperation and engagement; and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nDON also stated in 2014 that\nThe Reserve Component expeditionary forces are integrated with the Active Component forces to provide a continuum of capabilities unique to the maritime environment within NECC. Blending the AC and RC brings strength to the force and is an important part of the Navy's ability to carry out the Naval Maritime Strategy from blue water into green and brown water and in direct support of the Joint Force. The Navy Reserve trains and equips over half of the Sailors supporting NECC missions, including naval construction and explosive ordnance disposal in the CENTCOM region, as well as maritime expeditionary security, expeditionary logistics (cargo handling battalions), maritime civil affairs, expeditionary intelligence, and other mission capabilities seamlessly integrated with operational forces around the world. In addition, Coastal Riverine Group 2 has taken on a new armed escort mission for High Value Units (HVU) which has traditionally been provided by the U.S. Coast Guard. The escort enhances force protection for HVUs while transiting into and out of CONUS ports during restricted maneuvering.\n\n\t\t\tGlobal Maritime Partnership\n\nThe Global Maritime Partnership was a U.S. Navy initiative to achieve an enhanced degree of cooperation between the U.S. Navy and foreign navies, coast guards, and maritime police forces, for the purpose of ensuring global maritime security against common threats. DON stated in 2014 that \"through partnerships with a growing number of nations, including those in Africa and Latin America, we will strive for a common vision of freedom, stability, and prosperity.\"\n\n\t\t\tPartnership Stations\n\nThe Southern Partnership Station (SPS) and the Africa Partnership Station (APS) were Navy ships, such as amphibious ships or high-speed sealift ships, that deployed to the Caribbean and to waters off Africa, respectively, to support U.S. Navy engagement with countries in those regions, particularly for purposes of building security partnerships with those countries, and for increasing the capabilities of those countries for performing maritime-security operations. The SPS and APS can be viewed as specific measures for promoting the above-mentioned global maritime partnership. A July 2010 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report discussed the APS.\n\n\t\t\tCoastal Riverine Force\n\nThe Navy in May 2006 reestablished its riverine force by standing up Riverine Group 1 at Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, VA (now part of Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, or JEBLC-FS). Riverine Group 1 included three active-duty riverine squadrons of 12 boats each that were established in 2006-2007. Operations of the squadrons from 2006 to 2011 included multiple deployments to Iraq for the purpose, among other things, of relieving Marines who until 2006 had been conducting maritime security operations in Iraqi ports and waterways.\nOn June 1, 2012, the Navy merged the riverine force and the Maritime Expeditionary Security Force (MESF) to create Coastal Riverine Force (CORIVFOR). The Navy stated that CORIVFOR \"performs core maritime expeditionary security missions in the green and brown waters, bridging the gap between traditional Navy blue water operations and land-based forces, providing port and harbor security for vital waterways and protection of high value assets and maritime infrastructure.\" The Navy stated that CORIVFOR was scheduled to reach initial operating capability (IOC) in October 2012 and full operational capability (FOC) in October 2014, and that \"all current and scheduled routine deployments will continue as normal.\"\nA July 14, 2014, news report states the following:\nIn 2012, the Navy merged Riverine Forces and Maritime Expeditionary Security Forces to form the Coastal Riverine Force. There are currently seven squadrons. Squadrons 1, 3 and 11 are home ported on the west coast and Squadrons 2, 4, 8 and 10 are home ported on the east coast. The force currently consists of both active and reserve service members who man and operate more than 100 boats, ranging from rubber combat raiding crafts to 53-foot command boats that can carry up to 26 personnel.\nA January 18, 2013, Navy news report stated the following:\nSailors, former Riverines, and family members attended a disestablishment ceremony for Naval Expeditionary Combat Command's Riverine Squadron (RIVRON) 3 at Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, Jan. 17.\nThe disestablishment marks the merger of offensive Riverine forces with defensive Maritime Expeditionary Security Forces to form the Coastal Riverine Force (CORIVFOR), formally established June 1[, 2012]....\nCORIVFOR's primary mission is to conduct maritime security operations across all phases of military operations by defending high value assets, critical maritime infrastructure, ports and harbors, both inland and on coastal waterways, and when commanded, conduct offensive combat operations.\nThe budget-initiated merger moved portions of the force to San Diego as part of the National Defense Strategy's rebalance to the Pacific, which will bring Riverine capability to the West coast for the first time since 1974, according to Capt. Eric B. Moss, commander of Coastal Riverine Group 1, formerly Maritime Expeditionary Security Group 1.\n\"The Riverine forces will do what they've always done, which is continuing to hone their skills and work in brown water and green water areas,\" said Moss. \"There is no abatement of requirements. We continue to get missions and are sourced to meet those requirements. We're doing the same with less.\"\nThe merge cuts the former seven active Maritime Expeditionary Security Force (MESF) squadrons and three active RIVRONs down to three active Coastal Riverine squadrons and four reserve squadrons.\n\"This is a reduction in capacity, but not in capability,\" said Moss. \"I would say this is a very affordable force. We are light, expeditionary, and bring a lot capability in small packages. We are familiar with disaggregated operations, so immediately we give the combatant commander a tailor-able and scalable force.\"...\nCommissioned July 6, 2007, RIVRON 3 served two deployments in Iraq, fulfilling a total of 502 combat missions, 268 water security operations and countless U.S./Iraq tactical convoy operations.\n\n\t\t\tOther Organizational Initiatives\n\nOther Navy initiatives in recent years for supporting IW and CT operations include establishing a reserve civil affairs battalion, a Navy Foreign Area Officer (FAO) community consisting of officers with specialized knowledge of foreign countries and regions, a maritime interception operation (MIO) intelligence exploitation pilot program, and an intelligence data-mining capability at the National Maritime Intelligence Center (NMIC).\n\n\t\tAppendices with Additional Background Information\n\nFor additional information on Navy and Marine Corps special operations forces, see the prepared statements of the Navy and Marine Corps witnesses for an April 1,1 2018, hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee reprinted in Appendix A .\nThe Navy outlined its IW activities as of 2011 in its prepared statement for a November 3, 2011, hearing on the services' IW activities before the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. For the text of the Navy's prepared statement, see Appendix B .\nAs noted earlier, for the text of the Navy's January 2010 vision statement for irregular warfare, see Appendix C .\nA 2012 report on maritime irregular warfare from RAND Corporation, a research firm, provides additional background information on U.S. maritime irregular warfare operations, both historical and more recent (i.e., up to the time of the report's writing). The report also made a series of findings and recommendations relating to U.S. maritime irregular warfare; for a summary of these findings and recommendations, see Appendix D .\nAs noted earlier, for additional background information on detention of terrorist suspects on U.S. Navy ships, see Appendix E .\n\n\t\tFY2020 Funding Request\n\n\t\t\tOverview\n\nDON states that the proposed FY2020 budget \"continues funding to counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and for operations in Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and other locations in theater, as well as for the European Deterrence Initiative,\" and \"supports building a more experienced, better trained, and more capable force by increasing the number of Marines with special skills, like those required for special operations, intelligence operations, electronic, information, and cyber warfare.\" Special Operations Command's (SOCOM's) proposed FY2020 budget requests, among other things,\n$72.6 million in the FY2020 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, Defense-Wide (RDT&EDW) account for Program Element (PE) 1160483BB, maritime systems (line 263 in the FY2020 RDT&EDW account), including $45.2 million for Project S0417: Underwater Systems, and $27.4 million for S1684: Surface Craft; and $59.0 million in the FY2020 Procurement, Defense-Wide (PDW) appropriation account for procurement of underwater systems for SOCOM (line 63 in the FY2020 PDW account).\nFor additional background information on the FY2020 funding requests for lines 263 and 63, see Appendix F .\n\n\tPotential Oversight Issues for Congress\n\n\t\tDegree of Emphasis on IW in Navy Budgets\n\nOne potential oversight issue for Congress concerns how much emphasis to place on IW activities in Navy budgets, particularly in a context of constraints on Navy budgets and Navy desires to devote resources to developing \"high end\" combat capabilities for countering improved conventional military capabilities of countries such as China and Russia. Although the Navy, as discussed earlier in this report, took actions in the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, that were intended to improve its IW capabilities, the Navy in more recent years has taken other actions that might be viewed as reflecting a reduced Navy emphasis on IW. In that connection, the following points were provided to CRS by the Joint Staff J-7 Irregular Warfare office in August 2016:\n\"US Navy IW funding and force structure have declined over the last few years.\" \"NIWO's responsibilities now belong to OPNAV N515 [i.e., the office within the Chief of Naval Operations that oversees the NWG], with dedicated IW staff decreasing from 13 government/military personnel along with 6 contractors led by a RDML [rear admiral] to 2 contractors and one O-5 [an officer that in the Navy is a commander] under O-6 [an officer that in the Navy is a captain] oversight.\" In May 2014, the Navy closed its Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training Command (MCAST), an action \"which reduced civil affairs (CA) and security force assistance (SFA) capacity. The MCAST's mission was to train sailors to perform civil-military affairs and security force assistance missions. It also provided approximately 50 percent of Navy expeditionary training.... MCAST functions are now distributed across the Navy. The Naval Education and Training Security Assistance Field Activity serves as the focal point for security assistance training issues. The Expeditionary Combat Readiness Center processes individual augmentees for deployment. Civil affairs functions were not replaced.\" A July 2015 Navy memo states \"that the Navy does not 'possess dedicated CA units or members.'\" The Navy's FY2017 budget requested funding to preserve Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) Squadron 85, a unit that \"supports Naval Special Warfare and other SOCOM [Special Operations Command] assets,\" which was \"a positive development.\" On the other hand, the Navy in March 2016 \"disbanded HSC 84, a sister squadron providing similar support.... This action essentially cut experienced, operational capacity in half. Whether the TSUs [i.e., the two Tactical Support Units that are to be stood up under the Navy's proposed FY2017 budget] will meet SOF requirements remains to be seen.\" The Navy Community of Interest (COI) for Countering Irregular Challenges \"does not extend beyond the Navy Analytic Group. This body, tied to the Community of Interest, submits IW program gap, technical demonstration, and study initiatives to N515 for funding. Members include Fleet Forces Command, the NECC, the Navy Undersea Warfare Center, and the Navy War College. The larger COI has not [as of August 2016] had a formal meeting in approximately 3 years.\"\nA January 17, 2019, press report stated:\nAfter spending the better part of the past two decades supporting wars in a desert region, the U.S. Navy is starting to bring the SEALs back into the fold as it faces threats from major powers such as China and Russia.\nThe Navy is incorporating its elite special warfare teams into strategic calculations for every potential major power combat scenario, from China and Russia to Iran and North Korea, said Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Bill Moran in a round-table with reporters at the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium.\nThe movement toward reconnecting with the blue water force (the Navy's regular ships, aircraft and submarine forces) started under former Naval Special Warfare Command head Rear Adm. Brian Losey, who retired in 2016. The effort has continued to grow under subsequent commanders, said Moran.\n\"It's to the point now where we include them in all of our exercises, our war games, our tabletops \u2014 because as much as it is their chance to 're-blue,' it's our chance to reconnect from the blue side,\" he added. \"We've grown used to not having them in a lot of those situations. Now as we've done the tabletops, the exercises and the war games, we see: 'Wow, there is some great capability here that can set the conditions for the kind of operations in every single one of those campaigns.' And that will continue to grow, I think.\"\nThere have been indications that the SEALs are specifically eyeing environments similar to those in the South China Sea. A recent environmental assessment obtained by the Honolulu Star Advertiser revealed that the SEALs were looking to triple the amount of training time spent in the Hawaiian islands, expanding from Oahu and Hawaii island to Kauai, Maui, Molokai and Lanai.\nA January 30, 2019, press report similarly stated:\nHaving spent 17 years conducting counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations in the deserts and mountains of the Middle East, the Naval Special Warfare community is shifting its focus to threats from China, Russia and aspiring adversaries.\nNavy operations planners are including Navy SEALs in all aspects of planning and training, such as war games, exercises and tabletop scenarios, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Bill Moran told reporters Jan. 16 at the Surface Navy Association's annual conference.\nThe shift began in 2013 when Rear Adm. Brian Losey, then-commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, began making \"a concerted effort to talk to his teams about getting back to the 'blue side,'\" Moran said, referring to the Navy's large fighting forces of ships, submarines and aircraft.\nThat focus has continued since Losey retired in 2016, Moran added.\n\"[Losey] saw the 'great power competition,' he saw the threats of an emerging Russia, China, North Korea and Iran,\" Moran said. [SEALs] have a very specific and important role to play in all situations.\"\nSince the U.S. insertion into Afghanistan in 2001, special operations forces, including the SEALs, have focused on a specific selection of their skill sets, including small-scale strikes and offensive actions, counterinsurgency, hostage rescue, counterterrorism and countering weapons of mass destruction.\nBut these forces have other expertise that is relevant to both large-scale military conflicts as well as the type of posturing and competing for regional and global dominance that currently is happening, according to a 2017 report by David Broyles and Brody Blankenship, analysts at CNA, an Arlington, Virginia-based think tank that concentrates on the U.S. Navy.\nThose skills include preparing an environment for operations, reconnaissance, unconventional operations, military information support operations and foreign humanitarian assistance, according to the report, The Role of Special Operations Forces in Global Competition.\n\"Special operations forces have a greater role to play in today's global competition through a counteractive approach to adversary maneuvers,\" Broyles and Blankenship wrote. \"The United States has only recently recognized that adversaries are exploiting the U.S. view of 'preparing for future war' vice 'competing in the here and now.' \"\nMoran agreed that Navy SEALs have a unique talent set that the \"blue side\" had largely forgotten.\n\"We've grown used to not having them in a lot of situations. ... Wow, there are some great capabilities here that can set the conditions in the world for the kind of operations we are going to need in every single one of our campaigns,\" he said.\nA draft environmental assessment published by the Navy on Nov. 8 indicated that the SEALs are planning to increase training in Hawaii, asking to increase the number of exercises from the 110 events allowed now on non-federally owned land to as many as 330 training events on non-federal land or waterways and 265 training events on federal property.\nThe proposed training also would expand the area for conducting exercises to include Kauai, Lanai, Maui and Molokai, in addition to Oahu and Hawaii.\nThe training, in a location relatively near to and similar in climate to the South China Sea, where China continues to assert its dominance, is necessary to enhance the Navy Special Warfare Command's traditional skill sets, including diving and swimming; operating with submersibles and unmanned aircraft systems; insertion and extraction; reconnaissance and parachuting; and rope suspension training activities, according to the report.\nMoran said the SEALs' return to their roots will bolster lethality of the Navy as a whole.\n\"As much as it's their chance to re-blue, it's our chance to reconnect from the blue side,\" he said. \"That will continue to grow, I think.\"\nPotential oversight questions for Congress include the following:\nHow do current Navy IW capabilities and capacity compare with those of 5 or 10 years ago? Under proposed Navy budgets, how will Navy IW capabilities and capacity in coming years compare to those of today? In a context of constraints on Navy budgets and Navy desires to devote resources to developing \"high end\" combat capabilities for countering improved conventional military capabilities of countries such as China and Russia, is the Navy striking the right balance between funding for IW capabilities and capacity and funding for other Navy priorities? Does Congress have sufficient visibility into the operations of U.S. SOF, including Navy SEALs, to support congressional oversight over those operations?\n\n\t\tRole of Naval Special Warfare Development Group (Seal Team 6)\n\nAnother potential oversight issue for Congress concerns the role of Seal Team 6 in Navy CT and IW operations. A June 6, 2015, press report states the following:\nThey have plotted deadly missions from secret bases in the badlands of Somalia. In Afghanistan, they have engaged in combat so intimate that they have emerged soaked in blood that was not their own. On clandestine raids in the dead of the night, their weapons of choice have ranged from customized carbines to primeval tomahawks.\nAround the world, they have run spying stations disguised as commercial boats, posed as civilian employees of front companies and operated undercover at embassies as male-female pairs, tracking those the United States wants to kill or capture.\nThose operations are part of the hidden history of the Navy's SEAL Team 6, one of the nation's most mythologized, most secretive and least scrutinized military organizations. Once a small group reserved for specialized but rare missions, the unit best known for killing Osama bin Laden has been transformed by more than a decade of combat into a global manhunting machine.\nThat role reflects America's new way of war, in which conflict is distinguished not by battlefield wins and losses, but by the relentless killing of suspected militants.\nAlmost everything about SEAL Team 6, a classified Special Operations unit, is shrouded in secrecy\u2014the Pentagon does not even publicly acknowledge that name\u2014though some of its exploits have emerged in largely admiring accounts in recent years. But an examination of Team 6's evolution, drawn from dozens of interviews with current and former team members, other military officials and reviews of government documents, reveals a far more complex, provocative tale.\nWhile fighting grinding wars of attrition in Afghanistan and Iraq, Team 6 performed missions elsewhere that blurred the traditional lines between soldier and spy. The team's sniper unit was remade to carry out clandestine intelligence operations, and the SEALs joined Central Intelligence Agency operatives in an initiative called the Omega Program, which offered greater latitude in hunting adversaries.\nTeam 6 has successfully carried out thousands of dangerous raids that military leaders credit with weakening militant networks, but its activities have also spurred recurring concerns about excessive killing and civilian deaths....\nWhen suspicions have been raised about misconduct, outside oversight has been limited. Joint Special Operations Command, which oversees SEAL Team 6 missions, conducted its own inquiries into more than a half-dozen episodes, but seldom referred them to Navy investigators. \"JSOC investigates JSOC, and that's part of the problem,\" said one former senior military officer experienced in special operations, who like many others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity because Team 6's activities are classified.\nEven the military's civilian overseers do not regularly examine the unit's operations. \"This is an area where Congress notoriously doesn't want to know too much,\" said Harold Koh, the State Department's former top legal adviser, who provided guidance to the Obama administration on clandestine war....\nLike the C.I.A.'s campaign of drone strikes, Special Operations missions offer policy makers an alternative to costly wars of occupation. But the bulwark of secrecy around Team 6 makes it impossible to fully assess its record and the consequences of its actions, including civilian casualties or the deep resentment inside the countries where its members operate. The missions have become embedded in American combat with little public discussion or debate.\n\n\tLegislative Activity for FY2020\n\nDOD's proposed FY2020 budget requests, among other things,\n$72.6 million in the FY2020 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, Defense-Wide (RDT&EDW) account for Program Element (PE) 1160483BB, (Special Operations Command [SOCOM]) maritime systems (line 263 in the FY2020 RDT&EDW account), including $45.2 million for Project S0417: Underwater Systems, and $15.6 million for S1684: Surface Craft; and $27.4 million in the FY2020 Procurement, Defense-Wide (PDW) appropriation account for procurement of underwater systems for SOCOM (line 63 in the FY2020 PDW account).\n Table 1 summarizes congressional action on the above funding requests.\nAppendix A. April 2018 Navy and Marine Corps Testimony on Special Operations Forces\nThis appendix reprints the prepared statements of Rear Admiral Tim Szymanski, U.S. Navy, Commander, Naval Warfare Special Warfare Command, and Major General Carl E. Mundy, III, U.S. Marine Corps, Commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, for an April 11, 2018, hearing the Special Operations Command's efforts to transform the force for future security challenges.\nPrepared Statement of Rear Admiral Szymanski\nThe text of Admiral Szymanski's statement is as follows:\nChairwoman Ernst, Ranking Member Heinrich and distinguished Members of the Committee, I am honored to appear before you, and proud to provide an update on your Navy's Special Operations Force and the U.S. Special Operations Command's maritime component.\nAs you are aware, the security challenges facing our nation today are numerous, and are made more difficult by adversaries who are exploiting emerging technologies and gaining ground. We will continue to face Violent Extremist Organizations (VEOs), while the battlefield expands and becomes more complex and chaotic. Today, our most pressing security concerns involve the aggressive, coercive, and disruptive actions of near-peer competitors and rogue regimes. Exerting power by fighting below the level of armed conflict favors these players to the point that they are gaining advantages that threaten our national security. We must continue to be smarter, stronger, quicker, and more lethal than our adversaries, in order to protect our nation in a world that grows more complex every day.\nAs an enterprise of nearly 10,000 personnel\u20142,810 SEALs; 780 Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen; 4,100 support personnel; 780 reservists; 1,240 civilians\u2014your Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Command accounts for only 2.4 percent of the Navy's personnel. Our budget accounts for less than one percent of the Department of the Navy's budget, and approximately 12 percent of U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) budget.\nWe continue to have a global presence\u2014operating in more than 35 countries on any given day. We are networked with the U.S. Navy and Joint Forces, the interagency, and allies and foreign partners, executing missions in support of USSOCOM, the U.S. Navy, geographic Combatant Commanders, and ultimately, national objectives across a full range of political and operational environments.\nNSW's ALIGNMENT TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY\nThe National Defense Strategy (NDS) published earlier this year charged the Department of Defense (DoD) to be more agile, more lethal, and more innovative in order to maintain our competitive advantage. The Chief of Naval Operations, in turn, laid out the maritime responsibilities articulated in the NDS, focusing on increasing Naval Power through balancing capability and capacity with readiness and sustainment.\nAs the Commander, my challenge is to man, train, and equip the Force to be better positioned to support the NDS, the National Military Strategy and the Navy's Strategy for Maintaining Maritime Superiority, while supporting the operational requirements of the theater commanders. Furthermore, the long-term sustainment, health, and well-being of our people remains my highest priority.\nNSW RESOURCING\nAfter nearly 17 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are focused on reasserting our capabilities as the maritime component to Special Operations, properly postured to meet the threats of the future, enhancing our partnership with the Navy and exploring opportunities for increased integration and interoperability, while building capabilities and capacity with fleet, submarine, aviation and cyber forces.\nAcknowledging that manpower requirements have outpaced authorized and actual growth, we have spent the last year taking a hard look at our force structure to determine how we can best use the resources we have to optimize the impacts we are making on the battlefield. We looked at how to eliminate redundancy, redirect resources and merge assets to build depth and agility and how to meet transregional threats and provide increased combat lethality to the Theater Special Operation Commands. Optimizing our Force is paramount to meeting current operational requirements and provide greater agility to meet future requirements.\nWe recently collaborated with the Naval Post graduate school to conduct a maritime, multi-thread experiment in Southern California. The exercise allowed us to explore a realistic scenario using unmanned systems in a multi-domain (sea, air and land) environment. We learned a lot and advanced the potential use of artificial intelligence and human-machine teaming in current conflicts which will eventually increase our lethality while reducing risk.\nWe have made necessary investments aimed at increasing our lethality, and refining our capabilities that enable access to contested areas.\nWe have made significant increases in our unmanned aerial vehicle lethality by adding targeting capabilities, increasing the capabilities of current sensor suites, and using algorithms and artificial intelligence to speed up the targeting cycle.\nWe have modernized numerous small arms systems, including procuring a purpose built, full-time suppressed, medium range weapons system; a lighter weight medium machine gun that matches and, in some cases, surpasses the effective range of a .50 caliber machine gun; a sniper weapons system with optics and wind sensing technology; and shoulder-launched munitions that allow for very precise engagements through hardened structures.\nWe have made great strides in modernizing our maritime mobility platforms. In fact, our partnerships with maritime industries has never been stronger.\nWe have introduced high performance surface combatant craft into our fleet to serve across the spectrum of maritime operations. They include our new Combatant Craft Assault which replaced the NSW 11-meter rigid-hull inflatable boat and our Combatant Craft Medium which replaced the Mark V Special Operations Craft and the introduction of the new Combatant Craft Heavy.\nSpecial Operations Force (SOF) undersea mobility platforms provide uniquely capable, clandestine means to access peer/near-peer locations. To that end, we expect to introduce two new undersea submersibles this year\u2013 the Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS), which will replace our legacy SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV), and the Dry Combat Submersible (DCS), a new platform to our inventory.\nNearly a year ago, we piloted a deliberate effort to realize the Secretary of Defense's guidance of exploiting Industry's investment in technology to relentlessly pursue innovative and advanced operational capabilities for our warfighters at a greater speed, relevant to the pace of technology in order to outpace our adversaries. This venture allowed us to understand and take advantage of new DoD contracting and procurement authorities as well as maximizing the utilization of DoD and USSOCOM outreach-to-industry platforms such as Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) and SOFWERX.\nNSW has learned and applied how to effectively make use of these and other new and emerging opportunities to rapidly bring future operational concepts to the present: such as our realization of Artificial Intelligence-Autonomy of ISR Drones. This example among others, show promise to have exponential impacts on our capabilities to accomplish our mission in a more agile, lethal and sustainable manner. Our efforts\u2014to rapidly prototype, experiment with and lead in new and emerging technologies are aimed at delivering capabilities at the speed of relevancy to our warfighters.\nFinally, bottom up, operator-inspired innovation drives experimentation during exercises, and training eventually equates to relevancy and leads to greater success on the battlefield. With our component partners and throughout USSOCOM, innovation is happening at the unit level up and through headquarters. Our focus on innovation is driven by our people \u2013 buying down risk to our force while increasing our speed, accuracy, and lethality.\nPEOPLE: THE FIRST SOF TRUTH\nOur primary weapons system remains The Operator. We continue to invest heavily in our personnel, whether it's to train, retain or sustain them. We select, train and maintain persons of character, who are mature, highly skilled, culturally attuned and trusted to execute our nation's most sensitive missions.\nThank you for your role in the preservation of our Force with the 10-year, $1 billion Silver Strand Training Center-South, the single most important military construction effort impacting the current and future operational readiness of the NSW Force. Once complete, the complex will consolidate the training requirements of today's force, creating efficiencies and synergy of improved operational planning and preparedness, but also allow our operators to spend more time with their families and communities.\nWe remain committed to the physical and mental health of our operators, as we have a moral obligation to ensure their well-being. Preservation of the Force and Families, our Human Performance Program, and our most important initiatives involving Cognitive Health are about keeping our warriors in the fight, extending their service life, and giving them a high quality life post-service.\nWith strong Congressional support, the USSOCOM Preservation of the Force and Family program continues to meet and exceed the intent to build resilience and facilitate the long-term care of our operators and their families, while never forgetting our fallen teammates with ongoing support to our Gold Star Families.\nEmbedded professional care providers working within validated programs have helped turn the corner on many of the negative trends that have impacted those who have been in this long fight. Our usage data shows an increase in service members and families going to see clinical psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, nurse case managers, which speaks directly to de-stigmatization and trust. Similarly, there is a high number of cross referrals among the various care providers that demonstrates mutual support and clinical trust and reliance.\nIn regard to Human Performance, our athletic trainers, strength coaches and physical therapists provide tailored and operationally relevant programs have resulted in injury reduction and increased recovery time from injuries with a direct impact to overall team readiness.\nOur Warrior and Family Support staff provide hands on, personal touch and connection to our families and children, connecting them to all the Service-provided and SOF-unique programs that are so vital to the strength and resilience of our family members.\nWe have also learned that long-term physical and psychological challenges may result in impacts to one's memory, attention, processing speed, problem-solving, visuospatial function and impulse control which can affect operational performance and mission accomplishment. Given that we are in the longest continuous stretch of armed conflict in our history, learning about the cognitive health of our force is a critical initiative.\nWe have initiated a Cognitive Surveillance Program that will be a more pre-emptive approach to intervention where cognitive impacts are indicated. More broadly, this initiative will seek to identify injuries earlier, track individual trends, and assist in developing comprehensive treatment plans to aid in the recovery of our service members. The end-state is to get NSW operators back into the fight while contributing to their long-term wellness.\nThe Surveillance Program entails an initial baseline screening of all SEAL/SWCC operators within NSW by 30 June 2018; and ongoing re-testing every two years to assess significant change, similar to other routine exams such as dental or audiogram.\nAggressive efforts include increasing awareness of potential issues and not waiting for perfect solutions. Therefore, we are actively 'driving the science' through our blast exposure research efforts, ultimately looking to create a 'dive-table-like' approach to heavy weapons/breaching exposure levels and mitigation needs.\nNSW continues to seek and offer best practices as we develop our cognitive health emphases. We rely on education, informed research efforts, and leadership support across the continuum of care to help mitigate the range of brain injuries and increase recovery rates for our members.\nPart of that continuum of care focuses on our transitioning veterans, whether at four years or after forty, with a holistic, SOF-unique initiative called Future Former Frogmen, or F3. F3 focuses on ensuring the successful transition of our active duty into civilian life by leveraging our neurocognitive science initiatives, continuum of leadership development efforts, readiness support programs, and veteran's resources. F3 provides structure, process and guidance throughout the complex transition experience giving the service member access to existing programs to ensure NSW veterans remain resilient. SOF for Life, a powerful support network, continues from active duty life to veteran life.\nToday in Coronado, California, at the Basic Underwater and Demolition / SEAL school, otherwise known as BUD/S, there are approximately 100 of America's best and brightest going through training to be part of the Navy's elite special operations maritime force as part of the most recent class, Class 330.\nJust like those seeking to be part of my brethren's communities, those seeking to be part of the SEAL community, those who succeed in the 63-week course will earn their Trident.\nAt the end of 63 weeks, each student will have swam 48 miles; hiked or patrolled over 150 miles; and conducted at least 40 dives while spending a minimum of 60 hours, or two and a half days under water. As a class, at the end of those 63 weeks, they will have completed the equivalent of swimming from Cuba to the southern tip of Florida, then running to New York City.\nAnd that is just a snapshot of what we ask them to do before they have taken their first step into their first operation in defense of our country. It is precisely because of what we ask them to do, starting in Coronado, then around the world, through operation after operation, that we are focused on their long-term health, and the well-being of our Force and Families.\nNaval Special Warfare Command will continue to place priority on strengthening, equipping and protecting our people; outpacing our enemies in the employment of new technologies and accelerating trends, enabling us to compete below the threshold of conflict. We will refine and adapt our organizational structure to ensure Naval Special Warfare remains relevant and lethal, and when necessary, stands ready, willing and able to engage in combat to fight and win decisively for many years to come.\nThank you for your time, your care for our Naval Special Warfare community, and I welcome the opportunity today to answer your questions.\nPrepared Statement of Major General Mundy\nThe text of Major General Mundy's statement is as follows:\nIntroduction\nMarine Raiders are the Marine Corps' contribution to United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). Through specialized and advanced training, MARSOC builds upon its unique attributes and ethos as Marines to produce agile, scalable, fully-enabled, and responsive special operations forces (SOF) comprised of operators and special operations-specific combat support and combat service support specialists. MARSOC formations task organize for every assigned mission and leverage their robust command and control capability and their ability to fuse operations with intelligence down to the team level. All of these factors enable our Raiders to succeed in distributed environments and enable partners at the tactical and operational levels of war. MARSOC contributes to the SOF enterprise and US combatant commands by providing full spectrum special operations capabilities to combat complex transregional problems.\nEstablished in 2006, our organization continues to address the most immediate threats to our Nation and has become a key participant in the ongoing fight against violent extremist organizations. Accepting this, we are also cognizant that we must work to minimize pressure on our force and our families as we simultaneously prepare for future threats. We ensure preparedness by adapting our training methods using feedback from currently deployed forces to better prepare our Raiders for what they will encounter while deployed. Simultaneously, we minimize pressure on the force by ensuring adequate access to Preservation of the Force and Families (POTFF) resources. We recognize that our operational capability ultimately rests upon a foundation of outstanding individuals and their families. In order to safeguard and sustain MARSOC's human capital, our most valuable resource, we continually strive to balance operational commitments with time Raiders spend at home station. Part of our effort to take care of families involves ensuring that our POTFF program not only delivers responsive and effective support, but that it continues to evolve with changing demands and needs of our force.\nBackground\nDuring my tenure as the Commander of MARSOC, I have continually been impressed by the caliber of our individuals, be they Marines, Sailors, or civilians. They are well trained, well equipped, and provide the full spectrum special operations capability that has been crucial to success on the modern battlefield in places as diverse as Mali in West Africa, contested areas of Iraq, and Marawi in the Philippines. Twelve years on, MARSOC is maturing into a full and integral member of the SOF enterprise just as it continues to provide Raiders to counter our Nation's threats. Taking into account where MARSOC is today, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge some of the formative episodes in the history of our Marine Corps that got us here.\nThe United States Marines Corps' rich history is one that is replete with expeditionary operations against what we know today as irregular threats. These actions serve as the foundation for what is Marine Corps Special Operations today. Although the United States Marine Corps (USMC) did not provide a service component to the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) until 2005, the Marine Corps has demonstrated an ability to conduct and support special operations throughout its history.\nIn the early years of America's involvement in World War II, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was determined to bring the war to our enemies as rapidly as possible. Because of the Marine Corps' historical successes in small wars and its recent development of amphibious operational concepts, it was considered to be the ideal parent organization for the president's vision for \"commando\" operations.\nIn January 1942 the United States Marine Corps established two Raider battalions. The mission of the new Raider units was to spearhead amphibious landings, conduct raiding expeditions against Japanese held territory, as well as conduct guerilla-type operations behind enemy lines for extended periods. Marine Raiders were intellectually dynamic, morally disciplined, and physically fit with an irrepressible sense of duty, loyalty to one another, and imbued with a \"Gung Ho\" spirit in the face of adversity\u2026 much like the Marines and Sailors we select and train as Raiders today.\nDuring the Vietnam War and throughout the Cold War era, the Marine Corps did not formally possess a specialized unit. However, many Marines were members of specialized Joint and certain, tailored conventional units, such as force reconnaissance and Marine Expeditionary Units (Special Operations Capable). These units performed some of the types of missions we associate with Special Operations today. The complex global environment produced by the end of the Cold War as well as the world changing events of September 11, 2001, prompted an almost immediate need for additional special operations capacity capable of achieving operational and strategic effects. In light of these events and the pressing need for more SOF, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld called for the Marines to work more closely with USSOCOM.\nAfter validating an initial proof of concept in 2004 known as the Marine Corps Special Operations Command Detachment (DET One), the Secretary of Defense directed the Marine Corps to provide a permanent contribution to USSOCOM \u2013 what would become Marine Corps Forces, Special Operations Command \u2013 in November 2005. On 24 February 2006, MARSOC activated at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina as a service component assigned to USSOCOM. MARSOC today comprises a headquarters, one Marine Raider Regiment, one Marine Raider Support Group, and the Marine Raider Training Center. The Command has forces on both the east coast at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and on the west coast at Camp Pendleton, California. Presiding over a total force of approximately 3,000 Marines, Sailors, and 200 Federal Civilians, the Command is employed across the globe executing special operations missions in support of SOCOM and the geographic combatant commands that span the SOF core activities. With a focus on counterterrorism, direct action, special reconnaissance, foreign internal defense, security force assistance, and counterinsurgency, your modern-day Raiders also have the capability to directly support hostage rescue and recovery, countering of weapons of mass destruction, unconventional warfare, foreign humanitarian assistance, military information, and civil affairs operations. In order to achieve success and provide full spectrum capability across this wide swathe of core activities, we must prioritize our efforts.\nMARSOC Priorities\nUnderstanding our role as a force provider and capability generator within the SOF enterprise, we have taken the SOCOM Commander's priorities of \"Win, Transform, and People,\" and applied them to how we prepare our forces to accomplish assigned missions. To this end, MARSOC currently focuses on four priority areas: the provision of integrated full spectrum SOF, capabilities integration between SOF and Marine Air Ground Task Forces (MAGTF), future force development, and the preservation of the force and families.\nPriority 1: Force Provider\nOur first priority is to provide integrated full spectrum SOF that are task organized, trained and equipped to accomplish assigned special operations tasks. At any given point in the year, MARSOC has approximately 400 Raiders deployed across 18 countries carrying out assigned missions. We maintain three, forward task organized Marine Special Operations Companies; one each in Central Command, Africa Command, and the Pacific Command areas of responsibility. In addition to company-level deployments, we maintain one persistent O-5 (Lieutenant Colonel) level Special Operations Task Force in Central Command and a one-third rotational split with Naval Special Warfare Command for an O-6 (Colonel) level Combined/Joint Special Operations Task Force Headquarters, also in Central Command. At every level, these deployed formations bring integrated capabilities across all functional areas and allow us to operate across the full range of special operations missions. We believe that it is these high-end capabilities that provide our forces with a competitive edge against the adversaries we face.\nProviding our force begins with the recruitment process and continues through our assessment, selection, and individual training pipeline. We are focused on recruiting the best individuals from across the Marine Corps. Based on the results of our deployed forces and feedback from supported commanders, our recruiting and selection methods are working. Our training is progressive. As individuals earn new special operations specialties, they are moved to teams or special skills training environments. This training continues until deployment and covers everything from individual skill sets to high-end, advanced, complex unit collective training.\nIn order to assess and certify Marine Special Operations Companies for deployment, MARSOC has created the RAVEN exercise. Held six times each year, RAVEN emphasizes realistic decision making for company and team commanders and provides a venue to practice the full planning, decision, execution, and assessment cycle. Alternating between Gulfport, Mississippi and Smyrna, Tennessee, RAVEN is a living exercise that enables MARSOC to incorporate the most current lessons from our deployed units as well as anticipated enemy actions inform and support ongoing joint contingency planning. For example, our most recent RAVEN conducted in Tennessee, featured a more robust foreign intelligence threat that undertook both physical and technical surveillance against our Marine Special Operations Teams. During this RAVEN we also exposed our teams to the degraded communications environment we would expect to encounter when facing a near-peer/emerging competitor.\nThe training environments we create are dynamic. Not only do they prepare our Raiders for the current operational challenge, but they also evolve based on emerging threats and our expected participation in support of standing operational plans. Another benefit of the RAVEN exercises is its utility as a venue for integrating conventional Marine Corps resources into what is otherwise a SOF-centric exercise.\nPriority 2: Capabilities Integration with MAGTFs (Interoperability, Integration, and Interdependence)\nSecond, we provide a bridge for routine capabilities integration with SOF and the deployed Marine Air Ground Task Forces to fully maximize the complimentary capabilities of each formation; especially in light of near-peer/emerging competitors. Given the threats present on contemporary battlefields and considering those we expect to face in the future, it has become increasingly important for SOF to be able to integrate \"seamlessly\" with the conventional forces and vice versa. Conventional forces offer capabilities and a capacity that simply do not exist in our small formations. In today's complex operating environment, the extent to which we, across the Joint Force, are able to leverage one another's strengths, and thereby offset our vulnerabilities, could determine the difference between success and failure. Cyber and space based capabilities, intelligence exploitation, mobility, fire support, logistics and medical support, are all examples of capabilities that we partially rely on conventional forces to provide\u2013 especially in scenarios involving high intensity combat.\nExamples of interoperability and capabilities integration occur every day across the globe from Syria and Iraq, Afghanistan, the Philippines and remote locations in Africa. With deliberate efforts to participate in each other's wargames, exercises, and training, we can institutionalize these efforts to the point that they become routine.\nPriority 3: Future Force Development\nAs the operating environment evolves and more complex threats emerge, MARSOC must adapt its force to meet these new challenges. Constant and deliberate innovation, and evolution is critical to our success. Our concept for development is based on both a bottom-up driven process that incorporates immediate battlefield feedback into our training curricula, equipment research, testing, procurement; and a top-down approach that combines more traditional capability acquisition processes with longer-term future concept and wargaming efforts.\nRegarding equipment development and acquisition, we are tightly integrated with SOCOM and the Marine Corps and look forward to benefiting from the ongoing efforts of SOCOM's Acquisition Technology &Logistics, SOFWERX, and the Marine Corps' Rapid Capabilities Office. All of these organizations offer us an expedited procurement process for emerging technology. We have already taken steps to bring our vision to fruition with regard to capability development in particular technology areas. These include freeze dried plasma, semi-autonomous seeing and sensing capability, organic precision fires, counter-UAS rapid self-defense, unmanned cargo UAS and ground systems, rapid fusion of big data analytics and machine assisted learning, broadband tactical edge communications, and specialized insertion capabilities. As we research and improve our warfighting capabilities, we must kept in mind that our near-peer/emerging competitors are also making similar advances and investing in emerging technology. It is critical that we ensure that the technological capabilities we opt for are able to operate, communicate, and self-heal in a signals degraded environment.\nLikewise from a training perspective, we recognize the need to simulate operations in a degraded/denied communications environment that reflect what we might face when confronting near-peer/emerging competitors. We also plan to continue to improve our proficiency in the critical combined arms skills that both increase our lethality and allow us to maintain a tactical advantage over our adversaries. Last, we acknowledge that we must be able to operate in any clime and place, therefore we are committed to training in environments that replicate the full range of what we may experience on the battlefield.\nComplementing our near and mid-term efforts at capability development is longer term work on the development of a MARSOC-specific futures concept. Although this concept bears a resemblance to similar initiatives undertaken with the Department, it very much reflects MARSOC's unique place within SOF and interpretation of what the future operating environment might look like. We see a world overwhelmingly influenced by a resurgence of regional competition and instability. As these two themes collide, the complexity of the operating environment will dramatically challenge the ability of leaders at all levels to first, understand what is happening and, second, make sound decisions. This is the very situation in which Raider formations of the future must be prepared to operate; an urgent, volatile, complex, high-stakes problem that comprises multiple actors and defies the application of traditional US strengths and solutions.\nThe results of our futures analysis, conducted over the past 18 months, have provided broad implications for the force as well as options which MARSOC can use to shape future capability to meet the challenges posed by the future operating environment. Throughout our internal wargame series, four discrete concepts or 'themes' consistently emerged. Each theme describes a distinct aspect of a vision for MARSOC, but at the same time each built upon the others such that the four are interconnected and mutually supporting. Together they provide a strong conceptual basis for a future MARSOC force that outpaces changes in the operating environment and remains a reliable force across warfighting and Title X functions. Collectively, these themes have come together to form the four, core pathways of innovation: MARSOF as a Connector, Combined Arms for the Connected Arena, The Cognitive Operator, and Enterprise Level Agility.\nOur futures vision document, MARSOF 2030 explains each of these innovation pathways in depth and also explores how they interconnect with one another. I will briefly introduce them here for the benefit of the committee. 'MARSOF as a Connector' is intended to capture MARSOC's facility in building cohesive, task organized teams. It is the idea that MARSOC can be the ideal integrator and synchronizer of U.S. Governmental capabilities with USSOF and partner nation actions. It also acknowledges the non-military nature of many of the problems we face and the need to look beyond for more durable solutions that involve tools other than the military.\n'Combined Arms for the Connected Arena' aims to get at the requirement to 'sense' and 'make sense of' what is happening in diverse and multi-dimensional environments. This second pathway also speaks to the use of cyber and information 'domains' as potential venues for conflict now, but certainly with increasing relevance as we look toward the future. From our standpoint, we must become as comfortable operating in these 'virtual' domains as we are in the physical.\nPerhaps the most foundational of all of our innovation pathways is 'the Cognitive Operator'. This pathway touches all others. At its core is the idea that the future requires a SOF operator with an equal amount of brains to match the brawn; foresight in addition to fortitude. Your future Raiders must preside over expanded capabilities that include the ability to influence allies and partners; understand complex problems; apply a broad set of national, theater, and interagency capabilities to those problems; and fight as adeptly in the virtual space as the physical.\nThe last innovation pathway, 'Enterprise Level Agility', leverages MARSOC's relatively small size as an advantage. MARSOC possesses the advantage of being a relatively small force with its own component headquarters \u2013 this allows the command to rapidly reorient the organization to confront new challenges as they emerge. In other words, MARSOC's organizational dexterity can provide SOCOM with an agile, adaptable force to meet unexpected or rapidly changing requirements. In this context, MARSOC's small size becomes a strength; one that can provide both institutional and operational agility to the SOCOM Commander.\nPriority 4: Preservation of the Force and Families\nCalling to mind the SOF Truth that \"people are more important than hardware,\" our fourth priority is the preservation of our force and families program that provide our Raiders and their families with the access to resources promoting personal resiliency increasing longevity in service. Although listed as my fourth priority, preservation of the force and families is equally as important as the previous three priorities because people are at the heart of all we do. Currently, MARSOF special operators average 1 day overseas for every 1.9 days at home. Our capability specialists that enable communications, intelligence, air support, explosive ordnance disposal, and our canine handlers, vary by occupational specialty but average between 1 to 1.7 and 1 to 1.2 days deployed as opposed to days spent at home station. What these numbers do not reflect is the additional time that is spent away from home while training in CONUS. Although difficult to measure, Personnel Tempo or PERSTEMPO receives significant attention at all leadership levels within the Command such that we aim to balance our service members' schedules between training at and training away from home station.\nBecause of this high operational tempo, POTFF has become an integral tool for maintaining the overall health of our force through programs that are focused on improving human performance, providing resources for behavioral health, developing spiritual fitness, and offering other family-oriented opportunities that are designed to strengthen the family unit. We appreciate the continual support from Congress on providing the funding for programs and specialized capabilities to make these programs effective.\nCulture of accountability:\nClosely tied to these efforts, in concert with both SOCOM and the Marine Corps, is our command-wide push to enhance our culture of accountability as it relates to issues such as sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, personal accountability, and unauthorized media release. As an example, our reported number of sexual assault cases remains in the low single digits and we have not had any victim reported incidents in Fiscal Year 18. We attribute this low number of incidents to our constant command level messaging campaign and our strong Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) program. While we believe that even a single incident is one too many, we continue to strive to eradicate sexual and other forms of misconduct from our force. We strive each day to provide you SOF personnel that continue to embody the values of accountability, integrity, and commitment in honorable service to our nation.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, I am committed to providing Marine Raiders that provide the nation with full spectrum special operations capability and whose actions continually demonstrate our motto of Spiritus Invictus, or 'unconquerable spirit'. Your Marine Special Operators will remain always faithful, always forward. I thank the committee for your continued support of our military members and their families and also for your commitment to national security.\nAppendix B. November 2011 Navy Testimony on Navy IW Activities\nThis appendix presents the text of the Navy's prepared statement for a November 3, 2011, hearing before the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee on the IW activities of the military services. The text of the statement, by Rear Admiral Sinclair Harris, Director, Navy Irregular Warfare Office, is as follows:\nChairman Thornberry, Congressman Langevin, and distinguished members of the House Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, it is an honor for me to be here with you today to address the U.S. Navy's efforts to institutionalize and develop proficiency in irregular warfare mission areas. These efforts are vital to our national interests and, as part of a comprehensive approach for meeting complex global challenges, remain relevant in a time of uncertainty and constant change. To meet these challenges Admiral Greenert, Chief of Naval Operations, recently provided his Sailing Directions to our Navy emphasizing the mission to deter aggression and, if deterrence fails, to win our Nation's wars. Today, the Navy is engaged around the world conducting preventive activities that stabilize, strengthen, and secure our partners and allies providing regional deterrence against state and non-state actors, while at the same time fighting, and winning, our Nation's wars. We expect the demand for these activities to increase in the future security environment as a capacity constrained Navy seeks to maintain access and presence. Emphasis on increased training and education will enable our continued readiness to effectively meet global demand.\nAs demand for our Navy continues to grow, we continue to leverage our Maritime Strategy with our partners, the Marine Corps and Coast Guard. The maritime domain supports 90% of the world's trade and provides offshore options to help friends in need, and to confront and defeat aggression far from our shores as part of a defense in depth approach to secure our homeland. CNO's Sailing Directions, coupled with an enduring Maritime Strategy, underscore the Navy's focus on multi-mission platforms and highly trained Sailors that conduct activities across the operational spectrum. Key tenets of the force are readiness to fight and win today while building the ability to win tomorrow; to provide offshore options to deter, influence, and win; and to harness the teamwork, talent and imagination of our diverse force. While the Maritime Strategy spans the spectrum of warfare, the Navy's Vision for Confronting Irregular Challenges (CIC), released in January 2010, addresses mission areas of irregular warfare as well as maritime activities to prevent, limit, and interdict irregular threats and their influence on regional stability through, insurgency, crime, and violent extremism.\nThe CIC Vision is derived from our Maritime Strategy with the intention to implement steps towards increasing the Navy's proficiency in supporting direct and indirect approaches that dissuade and defeat irregular actors who exploit uncontrolled or ungoverned spaces in order to employ informational, economic, technological, and kinetic means against civilian populations to achieve their objectives. The CIC Vision is guiding the alignment of organizations, investments, innovation, procedures, doctrine, and training needed to mainstream CIC capabilities within the Fleet. These efforts are focused on outcomes of increased effectiveness in stabilizing and strengthening regions, enhancing regional awareness, increasing regional maritime partner capacity, and expanding coordination and interoperability with joint, interagency, and international partners. These outcomes support promoting regional security and stability and advancing the rule of law allowing good governance and promoting prosperity by helping partners better protect their people and resources. In addition to preventive activities, the Vision guides efforts to inhibit the spread of violent extremism and illicit, terrorist, and insurgent activities. To achieve these outcomes, the Navy is actively reorienting doctrine and operational approaches, rebalancing investments and developmental efforts, and refining operations and partnerships to better support a comprehensive approach to U.S. efforts. These efforts will provide a Navy capable of confronting irregular challenges through a broad array of multi-mission capabilities and a force proficient in the CIC missions of security force assistance, maritime security, stability operations, information dominance, and force application necessary to support counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and foreign internal defense missions.\nIn line with its strategy for confronting irregular challenges the Navy has leveraged key force providers, such as the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command, and established Maritime Partnership Stations, and Maritime Headquarters with Maritime Operations Centers to meet the demands and missions consistent with its strategy and vision. The evolution of intelligence and strike capabilities has enabled the Navy to meet urgent Combatant Commander requirements for counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations and highlighted further opportunities for the Navy as an important joint partner. While these operational organizations and activities deliver Navy capabilities in theater, the Navy Irregular Warfare Office, established by the CNO in July 2008, has guided the implementation and institutionalization of the CIC Vision. The Navy Irregular Warfare Office, working closely with USSOCOM, other Combatant Commanders, Services, interagency and international partners, has rapidly identified and deployed Navy capabilities to today's fight, and is institutionalizing confronting irregular challenges concepts in the Navy's planning, investment, and capability development.\nThe Navy Irregular Warfare Office operates under three primary imperatives consistent with the Maritime Strategy, CNO's Sailing Directions, and the Navy's Vision for Confronting Irregular Challenges. They provide integration and institutionalization in CIC mission areas and are; (1) improve the level of understanding concerning the maritime contribution to the joint force; (2) increase proficiency of the whole of Navy to confront irregular challenges; and (3) drive maritime and special operations forces to seamless integration in addressing irregular challenges. These three imperatives focus the Navy's implementation efforts and mainstream the concept that preventing wars is as important as winning them. Our Navy must be ready to transition seamlessly between operational environments, with the capability and training inherent in the Fleet.\nDepartment of Defense Directive 3000.07 directs the services to \"improve DoD proficiency for irregular warfare, which also enhances its conduct of stability operations\" and directs reporting to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff annually. Navy efforts to institutionalize and provide proficiency in confronting irregular challenges, includes proficiency in irregular warfare missions along with missions of maritime security operations and information dominance, a key enabler for CIC. Currently, the Navy leverages its access and persistent presence to both better understand and respond to irregular challenges and is actively evolving its proficiency to prevent and counter irregular threats while maintaining its ability to conduct the full spectrum of naval warfare. Its access, presence, and emphasis on maritime partnerships enable broader government efforts to address underlying conditions of instability that enhance regional security. Through its mix of multi-mission capabilities, the Navy provides political leaders with a range of offshore options for limiting regional conflict through assurance, deterrence, escalation and de-escalation, gaining and maintaining access, and rapid crisis response. In addition to its inherent ability to protect the maritime commons, its effectiveness in building maritime partner capability and capacity contributes to achieving partner security and economic objectives. Operating in and from the maritime domain with joint and international partners, the Navy is enhancing regional security while dissuading, deterring, and when necessary, defeating irregular threats.\nThe Navy acknowledges the complexity of the future security environment and continues to explore balanced approaches. Following are the Navy's current focus areas:\nFleet-SOF Integration: Navy's afloat basing support to special operations forces has extended their reach into denied or semi-permissive areas enabling highly successful counterterrorism missions. Navy provides inherent combat capabilities, multi-mission ships and submarines collecting mission critical information, approval for 1052 support billets for Naval Special Warfare, two dedicated HCS squadrons, and shipboard controlled UAV orbits supporting counterterrorism operations. The Navy is aligned to improve this integration through pre-deployment training, mission rehearsals, improvements to fleet bandwidth allocation, shipboard C4I enhancements, and C2 relationships needed to prosecute time sensitive targets.\nMaritime Partnerships: Establishing enduring maritime partnerships is a long-term strategy for securing the maritime commons. Legal, jurisdictional, and diplomatic considerations often complicate efforts to secure the maritime commons, especially from exploitation by highly adaptive irregular actors. In recognition of these considerations, the Navy is emphasizing partnership engagements with U.S. and international maritime forces to strengthen regional security.\nInformation Sharing Initiatives: In an information dominated environment, initiatives that link joint warfighters, the technology community, and academia are crucial to rapidly fielding solutions to emerging irregular challenges. These initiatives are the basis for longer-term efforts to adapt and improve proficiency of Navy platforms to address irregular challenges.\nDoctrine: Development of Tri-Service (Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard) Maritime Stability Operations doctrine that will enable a more effective response to instability in the littorals.\nOrganization: Navy Expeditionary Combat Command, which continues to provide in-demand capabilities such as Maritime Civil Affairs Teams, Riverine Forces, Maritime Security Forces, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Teams, and Expeditionary Intelligence Teams.\nToday, the Navy continues to meet planned global operational commitments and respond to crises as they emerge. Overseas Contingency Operations continue with more than 12,000 active and reserve Sailors serving around the globe and another 15,000 at sea in Central Command. Navy's Carrier Strike Groups provide 30 percent of the close air support for troops on the ground in Afghanistan and our Navy and Marine Corps pilots fly almost 60% of electronic attack missions. Yet, as our national interests extend beyond Iraq and Afghanistan, so do the operations of our Navy. Over the last year, more than 50 percent of our Navy has been underway daily; globally present, and persistently engaged. Last year, our Navy conducted counter-piracy operations in the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea with a coalition of several nations, trained local forces in maritime security as part of our Global Maritime Partnership initiatives in Europe, South America, Africa and the Pacific and forces in the Sixth Fleet supported NATO in complex operations in Libya. Navy responded with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to the earthquake in Haiti, the flooding in Pakistan, and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan; and, conducted the world's largest maritime exercise, Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC), which brought together 14 nations and more than 20,000 military personnel, to improve coordination and trust in multi-national operations in the Pacific. Our Sailors continue to deploy forward throughout the world, projecting US influence, responding to contingencies, and building international relationships that enable the safe, secure, and free flow of commerce that underpins our economic prosperity and advances the mission areas that address irregular challenges.\nThe future vision of the Navy in meeting the uncertain challenges around the globe remains a force forward, present, and persistent in areas critical to the national interests of the United States. CNO, in previous testimony, stated: Our Navy continues to conduct a high tempo of global operations, which we expect to continue even as forces draw down in Afghanistan. Global trends in economics, demographics, resources, and climate change portend an increased demand for maritime presence, power, and influence. America's prosperity depends on the seas\u2026 and as disruption and disorder persist in our security environment, maritime activity will evolve and expand. Seapower allows our nation to maintain U.S. presence and influence globally and, when necessary, project power without a costly, sizeable, or permanent footprint ashore. We will continue to maintain a forward-deployed presence around the world to prevent conflict, increase interoperability with our allies, enhance the maritime security and capacity of our traditional and emerging partners, confront irregular challenges, and respond to crises. To continue as a global force in the preventive and responsive mission areas that confront irregular challenges, including those of irregular warfare, the Navy will be faced with increasing demand in a fiscally induced capacity constrained environment. Constrained capacity requires a prioritization of areas requiring persistent presence, to include those regions of current or forecast instability. Also required is an understanding of the risk incurred to mission, and to force, if we do not get that priority correct. We must ensure our Navy remains the finest, best trained, and most ready in the world to sustain key mission areas that support confronting irregular challenges, and has the ability to face a highly capable adversary. The Navy looks forward to working with Congress to address our future challenges and thank you for your support of the Navy's mission and personnel at this critical crossroads in U.S. history.\nAppendix C. 2010 Navy Irregular Warfare Vision Statement\nThis appendix reproduces the Navy's January 2010 vision statement for irregular warfare.\nAppendix D. 2012 RAND Corporation Report Findings and Recommendations\nThis appendix presents findings and recommendations from a 2012 report on maritime regular warfare by RAND Corporation, a research firm.\nFindings\nThe report made the following findings, among others:\nThe study's main findings span the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Several are specific to MIW, while others have implications both for MIW [maritime irregular warfare] and for IW operations more broadly.\nFirst, the maritime force is generally considered to play a supportive role to ground forces in IW and therefore has the potential to be underutilized even in IW operations conducted in a predominantly maritime environment ....\nSecond, countries that have a prevalent maritime dimension associated with an insurgency could potentially benefit from the enhancement of civil-military operations (CMOs) in the maritime arena ....\nThird, maritime operations in IW can allow the United States to scale its ground involvement in useful ways ....\nFourth, if one assumes that future MIW engagements that entail building a partner's capacity will resemble OEF-P [Operation Enduring Freedom\u2014Philippines], it is important to manage strategic expectations based on realistic assessments of the partner's capabilities ....\nFifth, when building partner capacity, either in MIW or land-based IW, the United States should make efforts to provide equipment and technology that the partner will be able to maintain and operate without difficulty ....\nSixth, with regard to operational methods, coastal maritime interdiction can play an instrumental role in setting the conditions for success in IW by cutting the supply lines that sustain an insurgency ....\nSeventh, as the [1980s] Nicaragua case illustrates, U.S. partners in MIW may only have to influence and monitor the sensibilities of a local population, but the legitimacy of U.S. involvement may be tested in worldwide public opinion ....\nFinally, international cooperation in confronting MIW adversaries is often necessary, and the U.S. Navy should make an effort to ensure that it is tactically and operationally interoperable with partner navies in order to facilitate coordination ....\nRecommendations\nThe report made the following recommendations, among others:\nThe findings presented here have several direct implications for the U.S. conventional Navy and Naval Special Warfare Command (NSW). First, U.S. naval forces should continue to provide U.S. partners with suitable equipment that they will be able to operate and maintain and should continually strive to increase their interoperability with partner forces. Second, U.S. naval forces may have to continue or expand training of partner forces to confront future MIW threats. Third, when conducting MIW, operating from a sea base offers advantages to NSW. However, due to the costs of such a practice, both NSW and the conventional Navy must also recognize that decisions regarding when and where to support sea basing of this sort need to be made carefully. Fourth, in support of future MIW operations, NSW is likely to have ongoing requirements for maritime interdiction and containment. Fifth, the United States could benefit from maintaining operational and tactical capabilities with which to assist its partners in surveillance, particularly against small submarines and mining threats. Sixth, NSW should consider increasing its capacity to conduct maritime-based CMOs.\nConventional U.S. naval forces should similarly consider their role in supporting significant irregular ground operations launched from the sea, as well as their role in interdiction and containment campaigns. In contrast to those of NSW, conventional U.S. Navy capabilities to support IW might entail CMOs and related activities to a greater extent than direct action.\nAppendix E. Detention of Terrorist Suspects on U.S. Navy Ships\nThis appendix presents additional background information on detention of terrorist suspects on U.S. Navy ships.\nOn July 6, 2011, it was reported that\nThe U.S. military captured a Somali terrorism suspect [named Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame] in the Gulf of Aden in April and interrogated him for more than two months aboard a U.S. Navy ship before flying him this week to New York, where he has been indicted on federal charges....\nOther U.S. officials, interviewed separately, said Warsame and another individual were apprehended aboard a boat traveling from Yemen to Somalia by the U.S. military's Joint Operations Command. The vessel was targeted because the United States had acquired intelligence that potentially significant operatives were on board, the officials said. Court documents said the capture took place April 19.\nOne of the senior administration officials who briefed reporters said that the other suspect was released \"after a very short period of time\" after the military \"determined that Warsame was an individual that we were very much interested in for further interrogation.\"\nAccording to court documents, Warsame was interrogated on \"all but a daily basis\" by military and civilian intelligence interrogators. During that time, officials in Washington held a number of meetings to discuss the intelligence being gleaned, Warsame's status and what to do with him.\nThe options, one official said, were to release him, transfer him to a third country, keep him prisoner aboard the ship, subject him to trial by a military commission or allow a federal court to try him. The decision to seek a federal indictment, this official said, was unanimous.\nAdministration officials have argued that military commission jurisdiction is too narrow for some terrorism cases - particularly for a charge of material support for terrorist groups - and the Warsame case appeared to provide an opportunity to try to prove the point.\nBut some human rights and international law experts criticized what they saw as at least a partial return to the discredited \"black site\" prisons the CIA maintained during the Bush administration....\nWarsame was questioned aboard the ship because interrogators \"believed that moving him to another facility would interrupt the process and risk ending the intelligence flow,\" one senior administration official said.\nThe official said Warsame \"at all times was treated in a manner consistent with all Department of Defense policies\" - following the Army Field Manual - and the Geneva Conventions.\nWarsame was not provided access to an attorney during the initial two months of questioning, officials said. But \"thereafter, there was a substantial break from any questioning of the defendant of four days,\" court documents said. \"After this break, the defendant was advised of his Miranda rights\" - including his right to legal representation \u2013 \"and, after waiving those rights, spoke to law enforcement agents.\"\nThe four-day break and separate questioning were designed to avoid tainting the court case with information gleaned through un-Mirandized intelligence interrogation, an overlap that has posed a problem in previous cases. The questioning continued for seven days, \"and the defendant waived his Miranda rights at the start of each day,\" the documents said....\nU.S. Navy Vice Adm. William H. McRaven alluded to the captures in testimony before a Senate committee last week in which he lamented the lack of clear plans and legal approvals for the handling of terrorism suspects seized beyond the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan.\nAt one point in the hearing, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, referred to \"the question of the detention of people\" and noted that McRaven had \"made reference to a couple, I think, that are on a ship.\"\nMcRaven replied affirmatively, saying, \"It depends on the individual case, and I'd be more than happy to discuss the cases that we've dealt with.\"\nAnother press report on July 6, 2011, stated the following:\nIn a telephone briefing with reporters, senior administration officials said Mr. Warsame and another person were captured by American forces somewhere \"in the Gulf region\" on April 19. Another official separately said the two were picked up on a fishing trawler in international waters between Yemen and Somalia. That other person was released.\nMr. Warsame was taken to a naval vessel, where he was questioned for the next two months by military interrogators, the officials said. They said his detention was justified by the laws of war, but declined to say whether their theory was that the Shabab are covered by Congress's authorization to use military force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks; whether the detention was justified by his interactions with Al Qaeda's Yemen branch; or something else.\nThe officials also said interrogators used only techniques in the Army Field Manual, which complies with the Geneva Conventions. But they did not deliver a Miranda warning because they were seeking to gather intelligence, not court evidence. One official called those sessions \"very, very productive,\" but declined to say whether his information contributed to a drone attack in Somalia last month.\nAfter about two months, Mr. Warsame was given a break for several days. Then a separate group of law enforcement interrogators came in. They delivered a Miranda warning, but he waived his rights to remain silent and have a lawyer present and continued to cooperate, the officials said, meaning that his subsequent statements would likely be admissible in court.\nThroughout that period, administration officials were engaged in deliberations about what to do with Mr. Warsame's case. Eventually, they \"unanimously\" decided to prosecute him in civilian court. If he is convicted of all the charges against him, he would face life in prison.\nLast week, Vice Adm. William H. McRaven, who was until recently in charge of the military's Joint Special Operations Command, told a Senate hearing that detainees are sometimes kept on Navy ships until the Justice Department can build a case against them, or they are transferred to other countries for detention.\nAnother senior administration official said Tuesday that such detentions are extremely rare, and that no other detainees are now being held on a Navy ship.\nA July 7, 2011, press report stated the following:\nIn interrogating a Somali man for months aboard a Navy ship before taking him to New York this week for a civilian trial on terrorism charges, the Obama administration is trying out a new approach for dealing with foreign terrorism suspects.\nThe administration, which was seeking to avoid sending a new prisoner to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, drew praise and criticism on Wednesday [July 6] for its decisions involving the Somali suspect, Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, accused of aiding Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen and the Shabab, the Somali militant group.\nA July 6, 2011, entry in a blog that reports on naval-related events stated that the U.S. Navy ship to which Warsame was taken was the amphibious assault ship Boxer (LHD-4).\nAn October 24, 2012, press report stated the following:\nOver the past two years, the Obama administration has been secretly developing a new blueprint for pursuing terrorists, a next-generation targeting list called the \"disposition matrix.\"\nThe matrix contains the names of terrorism suspects arrayed against an accounting of the resources being marshaled to track them down, including sealed indictments and clandestine operations. U.S. officials said the database is designed to go beyond existing kill lists, mapping plans for the \"disposition\" of suspects beyond the reach of American drones.\nAlthough the matrix is a work in progress, the effort to create it reflects a reality setting in among the nation's counterterrorism ranks: The United States' conventional wars are winding down, but the government expects to continue adding names to kill or capture lists for years....\nThe database is meant to map out contingencies, creating an operational menu that spells out each agency's role in case a suspect surfaces in an unexpected spot. \"If he's in Saudi Arabia, pick up with the Saudis,\" the former official said. \"If traveling overseas to al-Shabaab [in Somalia] we can pick him up by ship. If in Yemen, kill or have the Yemenis pick him up.\"\nOfficials declined to disclose the identities of suspects on the matrix. They pointed, however, to the capture last year of alleged al-Qaeda operative Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame off the coast of Yemen. Warsame was held for two months aboard a U.S. ship before being transferred to the custody of the Justice Department and charged in federal court in New York.\n\"Warsame was a classic case of 'What are we going to do with him?'\" the former counterterrorism official said. In such cases, the matrix lays out plans, including which U.S. naval vessels are in the vicinity and which charges the Justice Department should prepare.\nAn October 6, 2013, press report stated the following:\nAn accused operative for Al Qaeda seized by United States commandos in Libya over the weekend is being interrogated while in military custody on a Navy ship in the Mediterranean Sea, officials said on Sunday [October 6]. He is expected eventually to be sent to New York for criminal prosecution.\nThe fugitive, known as Abu Anas al-Libi, is seen as a potential intelligence gold mine, possessing perhaps two decades of information about Al Qaeda, from its early days under Osama bin Laden in Sudan to its more scattered elements today. \nThe decision to hold Abu Anas and question him for intelligence purposes without a lawyer present follows a pattern used successfully by the Obama administration with other terrorist suspects, most prominently in the case of Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a former military commander with the Somali terrorist group Shabab....\n\"Warsame is the model for this guy,\" one American security official said....\nAbu Anas is being held aboard the U.S.S. San Antonio, a vessel brought in specifically for this mission, officials said.\nA June 27, 2014, press report stated the following:\nRight now, a suspected terrorist is sitting in the bowels of a U.S. Navy warship somewhere between the Mediterranean Sea and Washington, D.C. Ahmed Abu Khattala, the alleged leader of the September 2012 attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya, is imprisoned aboard the USS New York, likely in a bare cell normally reserved for U.S. military personnel facing disciplinary action at sea. En route to the United States for more than a week, he's being questioned by military and civilian interrogators looking for critical bits of intelligence before he's read his Miranda rights, formally arrested, and transferred to the U.S. District Court in Washington, where he'll face trial. Meanwhile, the sailors aboard are going about the daily business of operating an amphibious transport ship\u2014even as the ship's mission has been redefined by the new passenger in their midst.\nThis isn't the first time the Navy has played such a critical, curious, and largely under-reported role in U.S. counterterrorism efforts. In 2011, Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a military commander for the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab, was captured aboard a fishing boat in the Gulf of Aden and detained by the Navy, on the high seas, for two months. In 2013, Abu Anas al-Libi, the alleged mastermind of the 1998 terrorist attacks on American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, was held aboard the USS San Antonio\u2014an identical ship to the one being used this week. Both men were interrogated at sea before being flown to the United States to face criminal charges in federal courts....\nIn many ways, it's not surprising that the U.S. government has been turning Navy assets into floating prisons for these dangerous men. Taking the slow route back to the United States offers interrogators the time and space to gather crucial intelligence from high-value sources like al-Qaeda-linked operatives. During the two months that Warsame was at sea, a select team of FBI, CIA, and Defense Department officials, part of the Obama administration's High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group, questioned the Somali terrorist on \"all but a daily basis.\" He was cooperative throughout and some reports suggest that subsequent U.S. counterterrorism operations, including a drone attack in Somalia shortly after his capture, were a direct result of intelligence Warsame provided to authorities. While al-Libi was only detained at sea for about a week\u2014a chronic medical condition prevented him from being held on a ship for an extended period\u2014reports suggest that similar intelligence-collection efforts were underway in his case as well.\nThe U.S. government has also embraced the approach because it has limited options for holding and interrogating men like Abu Khattala after capture. The Obama administration remains committed to ending detention operations at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. While the facility is still home to almost 150 alleged terrorists, the United States has not sent any new detainees there since March 2008. Detaining suspected terrorists at other overseas facilities is likewise not an option. For a time, U.S.-run prisons in Afghanistan were a possibility. But the detention facility in Parwan is now an Afghan-run prison, and using facilities in other countries would raise a host of legal, operational, and humanitarian concerns. Even if U.S. officials were willing to forgo the opportunity to question Abu Khattala before he's arraigned in federal court and provided with a lawyer, flying alleged terrorists to the United States immediately presents its own set of problems. Seemingly small operational and political considerations about the ways in which the United States transports terrorists captured abroad have major strategic implications, particularly given lingering questions about U.S. rendition efforts under the Bush administration. In this context, the Navy has taken on the role of high-seas prison warden, even as lawyers continue to debate whether and what international legal rules apply to terrorists captured abroad and detained, temporarily, on a ship.\nAppendix F.

The capabilities of submersible systems and unique equipment provides small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct operations associated with SOF maritime missions\u2026.\nJustification:\n1. DDS: The DDS is a certified diving system that attaches to modified host submarines and provides for insertion of SOF forces and platforms. SOCOM has a cost share agreement with the Navy to support the modernization of the DDS in order to accommodate current and future Naval Special Warfare payloads as well as large U.S. Navy payloads.\nFY 2020 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Funding continues the support of the DDS modernization effort, which includes relocation of equipment inside the DDS Hangar to support current and future payloads. Funding also includes field changes for product improvements developed to overcome obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS).\n2. SWCS: Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) is a free-flooding combat submersible mobility platform suitable for transporting and deploying SOF and their payloads for a variety of SOF missions. SWCS will be deployable from a DDS, surface ships, and land.\nFY 2020 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Purchases two SWCS vehicles and support equipment, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), engineering change proposals (ECP), detachment deployment packages, and initial spares.\n3. DCS: The DCS provides SOF with a dry diver lock-in and lock-out capability that transports personnel and their combat equipment in hostile waters for a variety of missions.\nFY 2020 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Purchases initial spares, GFE, ECP, system integration lab, and simulator.\n4. SOF Combat Diving: This is designated a Middle-tier Acquisition program allowing for rapid fielding which provides the transition of SOF peculiar diving technologies for the SOF combat diver while conducting underwater, real-world missions.\nFY 2020 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Procures total of 10 divers' maritime environmental protection and diver navigation.\nPress Reports\nA November 30, 2016, press report states the following:\nUSSOCOM is currently pursuing two programmes to enhance the sub-surface capabilities of US Navy (USN) SEALs including the Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) and Dry Combat Submersible (DCS). Both solutions are fully enclosed vehicles for operators, thereby reducing any requirement for teams to wear rebreathing equipment during mission insertions and extractions....\nThe main difference between SWCS and DCS is range, with the latter solution providing a longer insertion distance with a greater depth capability.\nThe SWCS, for example, is being designed to replace legacy Mk 8 Mod 1 SEAL Swimmer Delivery Vehicles (SDVs), bringing an improved electronic architecture and software on top of the requirements list for NSWC. SOF sources associated with USSOCOM explained to IHS Jane's how the first SWCS could be delivered to the Command in 2017. This would be followed by extensive operational evaluation with NSWC elements ahead of initial and full entry into service, sources added.\nAccording to USSOCOM officials, a total of two SWCS platforms will be procured by the DoD in 2017, along with associated batteries, trailers, mission system suites, and spares. Capable of transporting six operators at low-level depths close to the surface, the SWCS can carry a total payload of 10,000 lb (4,535 kg). SWCS contractor Teledyne Brown Engineering was unable to provide further details to IHS Jane's because of operational security reasons. However, industry sources have suggested that the SWCS measures approximately 22 ft (6.7 m) in length and 5 ft in width.\nThe SWCS has yet to be officially designated, but the nomenclature Mk 9 is expected to be granted to the platform type. Teledyne Brown Engineering beat the incumbent manufacturer of the Mk 8 Mod 1, Columbus Group, to the programme in 2011 when it was awarded a USD383 million contract by the DoD.\nAhead of SWCS's entry into service, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) continues to assist the NSWC with ongoing support for legacy Mk 8 Mod 1 SDV systems. Work will include projects relating to SDVs as well as other NSWC-specific efforts associated with the Maritime Mission Systems Division. The latest support contract, worth USD4 million, was signed in December 2015.\nElsewhere, the DCS solution has been designed as a dry diver lock-in/lock-out solution, capable of inserting and extracting personnel and all associated combat equipment, including in hostile waters, according to USSOCOM sources. The development of this option follows the cancellation of the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) in 2006.\nDesigned to carry six operators, the DCS has a larger payload capacity than the SWCS, with the ability to carry up to 40,000 lb at depths as low as 58 m. Sources also informed IHS Jane's that the DCS could have a maximum operating range of 60 n miles.\nIn July 2016, it was announced that Lockheed Martin and Submergence Group would jointly design, develop, and manufacture the DCS for USSOCOM, with industry figures reiterating the vessel's ability to provide improved endurance and operating depths.\nAccording to Lockheed Martin, a USD166 million contract will involve the delivery of three DCS vehicles over a five-year period, with the gross weight for each vessel being more than 30 tons. A company spokesperson explained to IHS Jane's how NSWC concepts of operations would see the DCS launched at a stand-off position from surface vessels, before inserting SEAL operators over \"long distances underwater\" onto objectives and target areas....\nDetails regarding the DCS design remain scarce. However, sources indicated to IHS Jane's that the solution will feature technology drawn from Lockheed Martin's S302 Manned Combat Submersible (MCS) craft, which is capable of carrying six personnel as well as a pilot and navigator.\nAccording to Lockheed Martin company literature, \"The dry one-atmosphere environment of these vehicles provides an alternative to traditional wet submersibles being used by the US and international Special Forces communities today, and will deliver operators to their destination in better physical condition to complete a mission.\"\nVessels are fitted with standard inertial navigation systems and Doppler velocity logs, as well as a communications suite featuring an underwater telephone and a UHF radio; obstacle avoidance sonar; and fathometer. Additional sensor payloads, dependent upon mission requirements, can also be integrated, Lockeed Martin explained.\nThe S302 MCS measures 31 ft in length, and can operate 100 m below the surface for more than 24 hours. The craft can travel up to 60 n miles at a 5 kt cruising speed, although it has a top speed of more than 7.5 kt for rapid reaction.\nUSSOCOM continues to integrate Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) technology on board a variety of Ohio-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) and Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) for special operations support....\nAlthough a total of six DDS systems are currently in service with the USN and USSOCOM, by the end of 2016 nine submarines will possess DDS capabilities, enabling them to launch and recover SDVs, sources explained.\nFeaturing automated launch-and-recovery technology, DDS enables combat divers to enter and leave the dry dock individually, as was explained during a press briefing by NSWC officials at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC) in Tampa, Florida, in May 2016.\nIn 2017, the USN aims to concentrate on a series of modifications to the DDS in order to allow for the integration of DCS and SWCS, including the relocation of equipment stowage in the DDS and upgrades in lighting, cameras, and mechanical noise reduction.\nIndustry sources have noted that DDS solutions are being extended by 50 inches to enable the integration of DCS and SWSC variants, thereby supporting a 'mothership' concept of operations (CONOPS) for maritime special forces. This would enable SOF teams to insert at greater distances from submarines and surface vessels, before entering the water at a suitable stand-off range from target areas and inserting via onboard DCS or SWCS craft.\nA September 15, 2016, press report states the following:\nSEALs will soon have new underwater vehicles delivering them to targets that officials say will make a huge difference during missions.\nSEALs now use a delivery vehicle that one SEAL described as a kind of underwater sled. \nSEALs ride in the sled in full scuba gear completely exposed to the water, in often freezing cold and in \"pure blackout\" conditions and total silence for eight to 10 hours.\nAsk a SEAL what that's like, and they'll say it's like being locked in a cold, dark, wet closet for hours....\nThe new vehicles, which are called dry combat submersibles, will be akin to mini-submarines, and allow SEALs to stay warmer and drier for longer, and more physically ready, as they close in on their target. \nThat's a huge advantage for missions that one retired SEAL who is now a congressman described as \"can't fail.\"...\nThe vehicles will also allow the SEALs to communicate before a mission, compared with \"only seeing your buddy's eyes\" and a glow stick for 10 hours, the SEAL joked. \nThe first submersible is due to arrive in July 2018, and it will be operational as early as the fall. Final testing is to be completed in 2019. \nAs SEALs await the delivery of the first vehicle, they have two \"demonstrator\" vehicles to experiment with....\nThat demonstrator is about 39 feet long, is about 7 to 8 feet in diameter, and weighs about 30 tons. So far, it has gone up to five knots for 60 nautical miles....\nIt is also surface-launched, which means it is launched into the water by a crane or from a surface ships with a crane, versus from a submarine. \nThe vehicle is able to hold up to eight SEALs and their gear, in addition to a pilot and navigator. \nThe submersible consists of three compartments: a swimmers' compartment where the SEALs will ride for the duration of the time, a \"line in and line out\" compartment where they exit and enter the submersible, and a compartment for the navigator and pilot. \nThe swimmers' compartment is only about 10 to 12 feet long, which could be a tight squeeze for eight SEALs. \nStill, officials say it'll be a huge improvement over the current systems.\n\"The DCS Program is on track to provide a capability that our warfighters have not had in a long time,\" said Navy Capt. Kate Dolloff, who is in charge of all maritime programs for Special Operations Command Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. \n\"We still have a long way to go, but a stepped approach using technology demonstrators to mitigate risk and a close relationship with the user community has been extremely successful to date and led to contract award,\" she said. \nThe U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) finalized a contract in July with Lockheed Martin for the first submersible to be delivered in July 2018, with the option of two more by 2020\u2014an unusually fast schedule for acquiring new technology. \nThe total cost for the three submersibles is $236 million. \nThe timeline and cost is years shorter and hundreds of millions cheaper than a previous submersible program, which was killed in 2006 after cost overruns and other issues. \nThat program would have cost $1 billion for one submersible and have taken two to three times longer to build, officials said. \nOfficials say the costs are much lower because they're taking off-the-shelf commercial technology developed by Lockheed Martin and modifying it to fit their needs, whereas the previous program started from scratch. \nOfficials say the new vehicles will have 80 to 90 percent of the same capability, but will be delivered much faster at a much lower cost. \nThe new program also comes with a \"fixed price incentive fee\" structure, where the cost of the program is fixed and any overruns are shared with the manufacturer.\nA July 22, 2016, press report states that\n... a new 'missile sub' promises to deliver to battle underwater far more easily\u2014and keep them dry when they travel. \nCalled the Swimmer Delivery Vehicle, it will be built by Lockheed Martin and Submergence Group after winning a US$166 million contract to supply the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) with a new class of combat submersibles.\nAccording to Lockheed, the three 30-ton (27-tonne) DCS [Dry Combat Submersible] vehicles that it is contracted to build will allow warfighters to travel deeper and farther underwater than today.\nThe craft are dry submersibles that support two operators (pilot and navigator) plus up to six swimmers with the ability to lock them out and in. \n'The dry one-atmosphere environment of these vehicles provides an alternative to traditional wet submersibles being used by the U.S. and international Special Forces communities today, and will deliver operators to their destination in better physical condition to complete a mission,' Lockheed Martin says....\nIt will carry two pilots and six passengers, have a depth rating of 328 ft (100 m), a lock-out depth of 98 ft (30 m), and a top speed of 5 knots (6 mph, 9 km/h).\nLockheed says the new DCS will boast improved hydrodynamics and propulsion compared to the previous vehicles.\nAn August 20, 2014, blog post states the following:\nThe U.S. Navy is hard at work developing new underwater transports for its elite commandos. The SEALs expect the new craft\u2014and improvements to large submarine \"motherships\" that will carry them\u2014to be ready by the end of the decade.\nSEALs have ridden in small submersibles to sneak into hostile territory for decades. For instance, the special operators reportedly used the vehicles to slip into Somalia and spy on terrorists in 2003.\nNow the sailing branch is looking to buy two new kinds of mini-subs. While details are understandably scarce, the main difference between the two concepts appears to be the maximum range.\nThe Shallow Water Combat Submersible will haul six or more naval commandos across relatively short distances near the surface. The SWCS, which weighs approximately 10,000 pounds, will replace older Mark 8 Seal Delivery Vehicles, or SDVs.\nThe other sub, called the Dry Combat Submersible, will carry six individuals much farther and at greater depths. The most recent DCS prototype weighs almost 40,000 pounds and can travel up to 60 nautical miles while 190 feet below the waves.\nCommandos could get further into enemy territory or start out a safer distance away with this new vehicle. SEALs could also use this added range to escape any potential pursuers.\nBoth new miniature craft will also be fully enclosed. The current SDVs are open to water and the passengers must wear full scuba gear\u2014seen in the picture above.\nIn addition, the DCS appears to pick up where a previous craft, called the Advanced SEAL Delivery System, left off. The Pentagon canceled that project in 2006 because of significant cost overruns.\nBut the Navy continued experimenting with the sole ASDS prototype for two more years. The whole effort finally came to a halt when the mini-sub was destroyed in an accidental fire.\nSpecial Operations Command hopes to have the SWCS ready to go by 2017. SOCOM's plan is to get the DCS in service by the end of the following year.\nUnderwater motherships\nSOCOM and the sailing branch also want bigger submarines to carry these new mini-subs closer to their targets. For decades now, attack and missile submarines have worked as motherships for the SEALs.\nEight Ohio- and Virginia-class subs currently are set up to carry the special Dry-Deck Shelter used to launch SDVs, according to a presentation at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference in May.\nThe DDS units protect the specialized mini-subs inside an enclosed space. Individual divers also can come and go from the DDS airlocks.\nThe first-in-class USS Ohio\u2014and her sisters Michigan, Florida and Georgia\u2014carried ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads during the Cold War. The Navy had expected to retire the decades-old ships, but instead spent billions of dollars modifying them for new roles. Today they carry Tomahawk cruise missiles and SEALs.\nThe Virginias\u2014Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina and the future North Dakota\u2014are newer. The Navy designed these attack submarines from the keel up to perform a variety of missions.\nSOCOM projects that nine submersible motherships\u2014including North Carolina as a backup\u2014will be available by the end of the year.\nThe Navy has a pool of six shelters to share between the subs. SOCOM expects the DDS to still be in service in 2050.\nBut prototype DCS mini-subs cannot fit inside the current shelter design. As a result, a modernization program will stretch the DDS units by 50 inches, according to SOCOM's briefing.\nThe project will also try to make it easier to launch undersea vehicles and get them back into the confines of the metal enclosure. Right now, divers must manually open and close the outside hatch to get the SDVs out.\nCrews then have to drive the craft back into the shelter without any extra help at the end of a mission\u2014underwater and likely in near-total darkness. The sailing branch wants to automate this process.\nWith any luck, the SEALs will have their new undersea chariots and the motherships to carry them ready before 2020.\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "In the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Navy has carried out a variety of irregular warfare (IW) and counterterrorism (CT) activities. Among the most readily visible of these were operations carried out by Navy sailors serving ashore in the Middle East and Afghanistan, as well as the May 1-2, 2011, U.S. military operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed Osama bin Laden.\nDuring these years, the Navy took certain actions intended to improve its IW capabilities. For example, the Navy established the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) informally in October 2005 and formally in January 2006. NECC consolidated and facilitated the expansion of a number of Navy organizations that have a role in IW operations. The Navy also established the Navy Irregular Warfare Office in July 2008, published a vision statement for irregular warfare in January 2010, and established \"a community of interest\" (COI) to develop and advance ideas, collaboration, and advocacy related to IW in December 2010.\nThe Navy during these years also reestablished its riverine force and initiated The Global Maritime Partnership, which was a U.S. Navy initiative to achieve an enhanced degree of cooperation between the U.S. Navy and foreign navies, coast guards, and maritime police forces, for the purpose of ensuring global maritime security against common threats. In addition, the Navy operated the Southern Partnership Station (SPS) and the Africa Partnership Station (APS), which were Navy ships, such as amphibious ships or high-speed sealift ships, that deployed to the Caribbean and to waters off Africa, respectively, to support U.S. Navy engagement with countries in those regions, particularly for purposes of building security partnerships with those countries and for increasing the capabilities of those countries for performing maritime-security operations.\nThe Navy's current IW and CT activities pose a number of potential oversight issues for Congress, including how much emphasis to place on IW and CT activities in Navy budgets, particularly in a context of constraints on Navy budgets and Navy desires to devote resources to developing \"high end\" combat capabilities for countering improved conventional military capabilities of countries such as China and Russia.",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBackground\n\nEM oversees a nationwide complex of 16 sites. A majority of the sites  were created during World War II and the Cold War to research, produce,  and test nuclear weapons (see figure 1). Much of the complex is no  longer in productive use but still contains vast quantities of radioactive  and hazardous materials related to the production of nuclear weapons. In  1989, EM began carrying out activities around the complex to clean up,  contain, safely store, and dispose of these materials. Starting at about  the same time, DOE documents indicate that EM and state and federal  regulators entered into numerous cleanup agreements that defined the  scope of cleanup work and established dates for coming into compliance  with applicable environmental laws. EM has spent more than $170 billion  since it began its cleanup program, but its most challenging and costly  cleanup work remains, according to EM documents.\nThe processes that govern the cleanup at EM\u2019s nuclear waste sites are  complicated, involving multiple laws, agencies, and administrative steps.  EM\u2019s cleanup responsibilities derive from different laws, including  CERCLA, RCRA, the Atomic Energy Act, and state hazardous waste  laws. Federal facility agreements, compliance orders, and other  compliance agreements also govern this cleanup.\nFederal facility agreements are generally enforceable agreements that  DOE enters into with EPA and affected states under CERCLA and  applicable state laws. For each federal facility listed on the National  Priorities List, EPA\u2019s list of seriously contaminated sites, section 120 of  CERCLA requires the relevant federal agency to enter into an interagency  agreement with EPA for the completion of all necessary cleanup actions  at the facility. The interagency agreement must include, among other  things, the selection of the cleanup action and schedule for its completion.  Interagency agreement provisions can be renegotiated, as necessary, to  incorporate new information, adjust schedules, and address changing  conditions.\nStates generally issue federal facility compliance orders to DOE under  RCRA and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act. RCRA prohibits the  treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste without a permit from  EPA or a state that EPA has authorized to implement and enforce a  hazardous waste management program. Under the Federal Facilities  Compliance Act, federal agencies are subject to state hazardous waste  laws and state enforcement actions, including compliance orders. RCRA  regulations establish detailed and often waste-specific requirements for  the management and disposal of hazardous wastes, including the  hazardous waste component of mixed waste. Tri-party agreements  among DOE, EPA, and the relevant state often serve as both a federal  facility agreement and a compliance order.\nIn addition to federal facility agreements, other types of agreements  governing cleanup at specific sites may also be in place, including  administrative compliance orders, court-ordered agreements, and  settlement agreements. Administrative compliance orders are orders from  state agencies enforcing state hazardous waste management laws.  Court-ordered agreements result from lawsuits initiated primarily by  states. Settlement agreements are agreements between parties that end  a legal dispute.\nThese agreements may include milestones\u2014dates by which DOE  commits to plan and carry out its cleanup work at the sites. DOE has  identified two different types of milestones: enforceable and planning  milestones. Generally, an enforceable milestone has a fixed, mandatory  due date, subject to the availability of appropriated funds, whereas a  planning milestone is not enforceable and usually represents a  placeholder or shorter term of work. In this report, we are examining any  enforceable milestone that derives from either federal facility agreements  or other compliance agreements.\nEM manages its cleanup program based on internal guidance, on  milestone commitments to regulators, and in consultation with a variety of  stakeholders. First, according to EM officials, EM manages cleanup  activities based on requirements listed in a cleanup policy that it issued in  July 2017 along with guidance listed in standard operating policies and  procedures associated with this policy. The 2017 cleanup policy states  that EM will apply DOE\u2019s project management principles described in  Order 413.3B to its operations activities in a tailored way. Second, EM\u2019s  budget requests are explicit regarding the role the milestones play in the  cleanup effort. For example, in its fiscal year 2019 request to Congress,  EM stated that the request addresses cleanup \u201cgoverned through  enforceable regulatory milestones.\u201d Third, in addition to the milestone  commitments to EPA and state environmental agencies, other  stakeholders involved include county and local governmental agencies,  citizen groups, and other organizations. These stakeholders advocate  their views through various public involvement processes, including site- specific advisory boards.\n\n\tAt EM\u2019s 16 Cleanup Sites, Cleanup Is Governed by 72 Agreements, but EM Headquarters and Sites Do Not Consistently Define or Track Milestones\n\nAt EM\u2019s 16 cleanup sites, cleanup is governed by 72 agreements and  hundreds of cleanup milestones. These agreements include federal  facility agreements generally negotiated between DOE, the state, and  EPA, and compliance orders from state regulators. These agreements  may impose penalties for missing milestones and may amend or modify  earlier agreements, including extending or eliminating milestone dates.  Within the agreements, hundreds of milestones outline deadlines for  specific actions to be taken by EM as it carries out its cleanup work.  However, because EM lacks a standard definition of milestones, some  sites track milestones differently than EM headquarters, limiting EM\u2019s  ability to monitor performance.\n\n\t\tAt EM\u2019s 16 Cleanup Sites, Cleanup Is Governed by 72 Agreements, Most of Which Include Cleanup Milestones\n\nIn total, DOE has entered into 72 cleanup agreements at EM\u2019s 16 cleanup  sites. The agreements were initially signed between 1985 and 2009 (see  table 1). With the exception of the Moab Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial  Action Project in Utah and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico,  each site is governed by at least one cleanup agreement. Twelve are  governed by multiple agreements (up to as many as 17 at the Savannah  River Site, for example).\nTwelve sites are governed by federal facility agreements, generally with  the relevant state and EPA. These agreements generally set out a  sequence for accomplishing the work, tend to cover a relatively large  number of cleanup activities, and include milestones that DOE must  meet. All of the 12 sites with federal facility agreements are also governed  by additional compliance agreements that have been negotiated at each  site subsequent to the initial federal facility agreement or other agreement  with the state. These agreements may impose penalties for missing  milestones and may amend or modify earlier agreements, including  extending or eliminating milestone dates. For example, the Hanford Site  is subject to three consent decrees that resulted from litigation in which  the state of Washington sued DOE for failing to meet certain cleanup  milestones.\n\n\t\tEM Headquarters and Selected Cleanup Sites Do Not Consistently Define or Track Milestones\n\nEM headquarters and cleanup site officials provided us with different  totals on the number of milestones in place at the four sites we selected  for further review. Both federal facility agreements and other compliance  agreements contain milestones with which EM must comply and,  according to EM officials and our review of the agreements, these  agreements collectively contain hundreds of milestones. However,  milestone information that EM headquarters and site officials shared with  us was not consistent. For example, for milestones due in fiscal years  2018 through 2020, officials at EM headquarters identified 135  enforceable cleanup milestones at the four selected sites, which was less  than half of the number of such milestones officials at those sites reported  to us (see table 2).\nThese discrepancies result from how headquarters and selected sites  define and track milestones.\nMilestone definitions. EM headquarters officials said that they are  primarily concerned with milestones related to on-the-ground cleanup;  that is, cleanup activities that actually result in waste being removed,  treated, or disposed of. EM officials said they consider these to be  major milestones. However, not all sites make the same distinction  between major and non-major milestones and, as a result, are not  consistently reporting the same types of milestones to EM  headquarters. For example, officials at the Savannah River Site track  milestones in a federal facility agreement that lists 79 milestones due  in fiscal years 2018 through 2020. This agreement makes no  distinction between major and non-major milestones and includes  administrative activities, such as revisions to cleanup reports, in its  milestone totals. EM headquarters officials, on the other hand, do not  include these activities as major milestones and list only 43  milestones due in the same time frame. Similarly, Hanford officials do  not distinguish between major or other milestones in their internal  tracking. As a result, Hanford officials are tracking 178 milestones due  in fiscal years 2018 through 2020, whereas EM headquarters officials  are tracking 57 for the same time frame at Hanford.\nRequirements for updating milestones. Sites do not consistently  provide EM headquarters with the most up-to-date information on the  status of milestones at each site. This is because EM requirements  governing the submission of milestone information do not specify  when or how often sites are to update this information, so sites have  the discretion to choose when to send updated milestone data to  headquarters. As a result, the information on the list of milestones  used to track cleanup performance by EM headquarters may differ  from the more up-to-date information kept by the sites. For example,  officials at each of the four sites we examined stated that they try to  send updated information on the status of milestones to headquarters  on an annual basis, though they sometimes send it less frequently.  Officials at EM headquarters acknowledged that their list of  milestones is not always up-to-date because of the lag between when  a milestone changes at the site and when sites update that  information in the EM headquarters\u2019 database.\nIn addition to inconsistencies in tracking and defining milestones, lists of  milestones maintained by EM headquarters and the four selected sites  may not include all cleanup milestones governing the cleanup work at the  site. We found two cases in which permits at two sites included  milestones that neither EM headquarters nor site officials included in their  list of sites\u2019 cleanup milestones. For example, milestones related to a  major construction project at one of the selected sites we reviewed\u2014 Savannah River\u2014are not listed in either EM headquarters\u2019 or the  Savannah River Site\u2019s list of enforceable milestones. According to South  Carolina state environmental officials, milestones associated with this  project are part of a separate permit and dispute resolution agreement not  connected to the federal facility agreement or one of the sites\u2019 compliance  agreements. Recently, DOE acknowledged in its fiscal year 2019 budget  request that this project has faced technical challenges, and officials  noted that the previously agreed-upon start date for operating this project  would be delayed. However, this milestone and its delay are not included  in either EM headquarters\u2019 or Savannah River\u2019s list of milestones.  Similarly, officials at the Hanford Site said that some milestones  governing Hanford\u2019s cleanup are part of the site wide RCRA permit  issued by the state, which is separate from its federal facility agreement,  and, as a result, officials do not track this information in the same Hanford  milestone tracking system and do not report it to EM headquarters.\nEM does not have a standard definition of milestones for either sites or  headquarters to use for reporting and monitoring cleanup milestones or  guidance on how often sites should update the status of milestones. EM  headquarters officials cited guidance that sites can refer to when entering  their milestone data into the headquarters-managed database. This  guidance addresses how to submit milestone data but does not include a  definition of milestones or specify how often sites should update the  information. EM headquarters officials noted that sites have the  discretion to input milestones as they choose. EM\u2019s lack of a standard  definition of milestones limits management\u2019s ability to use milestones to  manage EM\u2019s cleanup mission and monitor its progress. We have  previously found that poorly defined, incomplete, or missing requirements  make it difficult to hold projects accountable, result in programs or  projects that do not meet user needs, and can result in cost and schedule  growth. In addition, according to Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, information and communication are vital for an  entity to achieve its objectives.  According to these standards, the first  principle of information and communication is that management should  define the information requirements at the relevant level and the requisite  specificity for appropriate personnel. Without this, EM\u2019s ability to use  milestones for managing and measuring the performance of its cleanup  program is limited.\n\n\tEM Does Not Track Sites\u2019 Renegotiated Milestone Dates and Has Not Consistently Reported Milestone Information to Congress as Required\n\nEM relies on cleanup milestones, among other metrics, to measure the  overall performance of its operations activities. However, sites regularly  renegotiate milestones they are at risk of missing, and EM does not track  data on the history of postponed milestones. As a result, EM cannot  accurately track the progress of cleanup activities to meet these  milestones. Additionally, EM has not consistently reported required  information to Congress, and the information it has reported is  incomplete. For example, in its report to Congress on the status of the  enforceable milestones, EM includes the latest (meaning the most  recently renegotiated) milestone dates with no indication of whether or  how often those milestones have been missed or postponed.\n\n\t\tSites Renegotiate Milestone Dates Before They Are Missed, and EM Does Not Track How Often This Occurs\n\nSite officials typically renegotiate enforceable milestones they are at risk  of missing with their regulators, in accordance with the modification  procedures established in federal facility agreements. EM officials said  that sites have the ability to renegotiate milestones before they are  missed. For example, the Hanford Site Federal Facility Agreement allows  DOE to request an extension of any milestone; the request must include,  among other things, DOE\u2019s explanation of the good cause for the  extension. As long as there is consensus among EM and its regulators,  the milestone is changed. Similarly, the Los Alamos Federal Facility  Agreement requires site officials to negotiate cleanup milestones each  fiscal year. Because renegotiated milestones are not technically missed,  EM avoids any fines or penalties associated with missed milestones.\nSite officials we interviewed at the four selected sites stated that it is  common for regulators and sites to renegotiate milestones before sites  miss them. For example, at the Savannah River Site, both DOE and  South Carolina officials said they could not recall any missed milestones  among the thousands of milestones completed since the cleanup began.  Similarly, Hanford officials told us that since the beginning of the cleanup  effort in 1989, more than 1,300 milestones had been completed and only  62 had actually been missed because, in most cases, whenever  milestones were at risk of being missed, they were renegotiated.  However, officials at these sites could not provide us with the exact  number of times milestones had been renegotiated. This is because once  milestones are changed, sites are not required to maintain or track the  original milestones. As a result, the new milestones become the new  agreed-upon time frame, essentially resetting the deadline.\nBecause EM does not track the original baseline schedule for  renegotiated milestone dates, milestones do not provide a reliable  measure of program performance. According to best practices identified  in GAO\u2019s schedule assessment guide, agencies should formally establish  a baseline schedule against which performance can be measured. In  particular, we have previously found that management does not have the  ability to identify and mitigate the effects of unfavorable performance  without a formally established baseline schedule against which it can  measure performance. We have also found that, without a documented  and consistently-applied schedule change control process, program staff  may continually revise the schedule to match performance, hindering  management\u2019s insight into the true performance of the project. In addition,  DOE\u2019s internal project management policies call for steps to maintain a  change control process, including setting a baseline schedule for  completing certain activities and maintaining a record of any subsequent  deviations from that baseline. EM uses milestones as one of its metrics  for measuring the performance of its cleanup efforts, since the milestones  are effectively schedule targets. However, since neither EM headquarters  nor the sites track renegotiated milestones and their baseline dates at the  sites, EM cannot accurately use milestones for managing and measuring  the performance of its cleanup program.\n\n\t\tEM Has Not Consistently Reported Required Information to Congress, and the Information It Has Reported Is Incomplete\n\nEM has not consistently reported required information to Congress on the  status of its milestones. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2011 established a requirement for EM to annually provide  Congress with a future-years defense environmental cleanup plan. This  plan is to contain, among other things, information on the current dates  for enforceable milestones at specified cleanup sites, including whether  each milestone will be met and, if not, an explanation as to why and when  it will be met. However, since 2011, EM has only provided Congress  with the required annual plan in 2 years\u20142012 and 2017\u2014and EM  officials told us in September 2018 that they were unsure when EM would  release the next future-years plan. EM officials said that, instead of the  annual plan, they have provided oral briefings to Congressional staff  during the 4 years when a formal report was not produced.\nIn addition, our analysis of the 2012 and 2017 plans EM submitted to  Congress identified three ways in which the plans provide inaccurate or  incomplete information on EM\u2019s enforceable milestones.\nNo historical record. First, the plans contain no indication of whether  each milestone date reported is the original date for that milestone or  whether or how many times the milestones listed have been missed  or postponed. Instead, the plans report the latest (and most recently  renegotiated) dates for the milestones without listing the original dates  or acknowledging that some of the milestones have been delayed, in  some cases by several years, beyond their original agreed-upon  completion dates. For example, we found that at least 14 milestones  from the 2012 plan were repeated in the 2017 plan with new  forecasted completion dates, but the 2017 plan gave no indication that  these milestones had been postponed (see table 3). The milestones\u2019  due dates had been pushed back by as many as 6 years without any  indication in the 2017 report that they were delayed. As noted above,  EM headquarters does not track changes to milestones and EM  officials at both headquarters and the sites said that they have not  historically kept a record of the original baseline dates for renegotiated  milestones they change. As a result, EM officials could not readily  provide information on whether the other milestones listed in the 2012  report met their listed due date or whether they were postponed.  Headquarters officials stated that to gather this information they would  need to survey officials at each site.\nInaccurate forecast. Second, the forecast completion dates for  milestones listed in the 2012 and 2017 plans may not present an  accurate picture of the status of the milestones and EM\u2019s cleanup  efforts. For example, in the 2012 plan, DOE reported that four out of  218 milestones were at risk of missing their planned completion date,  while the rest were on schedule. As discussed above, we found 14 of  the milestones in the 2012 plan had been postponed and listed again  in the 2017 plan. Similarly, the 2017 plan listed only one milestone  out of 154 as forecasted to miss its due date. However, because EM  does not have a historical record of the changes made to the  milestones, it is unclear how many of these milestones represented  their original due dates.\nIncomplete list. Third, the plans did not include milestones from all of  the 10 DOE cleanup sites that EM is required to report on. In 2012,  EM did not report milestone information for two of the 10 sites that  were required to be included in the plan. In the 2017 plan, information  was missing for one of the 10 required sites. EM headquarters  officials said that this could be because some sites did not update  their milestone information or some sites may still be renegotiating  new milestones. However, neither report indicated that data were  missing for these sites.\nAs a result of these issues, DOE\u2019s future-years defense environmental  cleanup plans provide only a partial picture of the milestones and overall  cleanup progress made across the cleanup complex, and actual progress  made in cleanup is not transparent to Congress. The absence of reliable  and complete information on the progress of EM\u2019s cleanup mission limits  EM\u2019s ability to manage its mission and complicates Congress\u2019s ability to  oversee the cleanup work.\n\n\tEM Does Not Analyze the Root Causes of Missed or Postponed Milestones and Does Not Have Guidelines for Considering Root Causes When Renegotiating New Milestones\n\nBest practices and DOE requirements for project management call for a  root cause analysis when problems lead to schedule delays, but EM  officials at both headquarters and selected sites have not analyzed  reasons why milestones are missed or postponed. According to best  practices identified in GAO\u2019s cost estimating guide, agencies should  identify root causes of problems that lead to schedule delays and  renegotiated milestones. Specifically, when risks materialize (i.e., when  milestones are missed or delayed), risk management should provide a  structure for identifying and analyzing root causes. The benefits of doing  so include developing a better understanding of the factors that caused  milestones to be missed and providing agencies with information to more  effectively address those factors in the future. In addition, DOE has  recently emphasized the importance of doing this kind of analysis. In  2015, DOE issued a directive requiring sites to do a root cause analysis  when the project team, program office, or independent oversight offices  determine that a project has breached its cost or schedule thresholds.  This directive, which applies to all programs and projects within DOE,  calls for \u201can independent and objective root cause analysis to determine  the underlying contributing causes of cost overruns, schedule delays, and  performance shortcomings,\u201d such as missed or postponed milestones.\nHowever, EM has not done a complex-wide analysis of the reasons for  missed or postponed milestones. Similarly, officials we interviewed at the  four selected sites said that they were not aware of any site-wide review  of why milestones were missed or postponed. According to headquarters  officials, this analysis has not been done because EM has determined  that DOE requirements governing this type of analysis apply only to  contract schedules, not regulatory milestones, and that missed or  postponed milestones are not necessarily an indication of cleanup  performance shortcomings. However, as previously noted in this report,  missing or postponing milestones is a systemic problem across the  cleanup complex that makes it difficult for DOE to accurately identify  cleanup performance shortcomings. Because EM has not analyzed why it  has missed or postponed milestones, EM cannot address these systemic  problems and consider those problems when renegotiating milestones  with regulators. Without such analysis, EM and its cleanup regulators  lack information to set more realistic and achievable milestones and, as a  result, future milestones are likely to continue to be pushed back, further  delaying the cleanup work. As we have reported previously, these delays  lead to increases in the overall cost of the cleanup.\n\n\tConclusions\n\nThe federal government faces a large and growing future environmental  liability, the vast majority of which is related to the cleanup of radioactive  and hazardous waste at DOE\u2019s 16 sites around the country. EM has  responsibility for addressing the human health and environmental risks  presented by this contamination in the most cost-effective way. However,  most of EM\u2019s largest projects are significantly delayed and over budget,  and state regulators for nearly all of EM\u2019s cleanup sites have responded  by initiating enforcement actions, often leading to additional agreements,  including administrative orders and court settlements, in addition to initial  federal facility agreements to ensure those risks are addressed.\nEM relies on cleanup milestones, among other metrics, to measure the  overall performance of its operations activities, and EM reports that very  few of its cleanup milestones over the past 2 decades have been missed.  However, EM\u2019s self-reported performance in achieving milestones does  not provide an accurate view of actual progress in cleaning up sites. EM  has not established clear definitions for tracking and reporting milestones  and does not have any requirements governing the way sites are to  update milestone information. As a result, EM\u2019s internal tracking of these  milestones has inconsistencies. Additionally, since the requirement to  annually report on the status of milestones was set in 2011, EM has  produced only two reports to Congress, and these were inaccurate and  incomplete. Without a clear and consistent approach to collecting and  reporting this data, including the history of milestone changes, EM cannot  accurately use milestones for managing and measuring the performance  of its cleanup program. The absence of reliable and complete information  on the progress of EM\u2019s cleanup mission also limits EM\u2019s and Congress\u2019s  ability to oversee the cleanup work. In addition, without a root cause  analysis of why milestones are missed or postponed, EM and its cleanup  regulators lack information to set more realistic and achievable  milestones. As a result, future milestones are likely to continue to be  pushed back, further delaying the cleanup work, which will likely increase  cleanup costs and risks to human health and the environment.\n\n\tRecommendations for Executive Action\n\nWe are making the following four recommendations to DOE:  The Assistant Secretary of DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management  should update EM\u2019s policies and procedures to establish a standard  definition of milestones and specify requirements for both including and  updating information on milestones across the complex.  (Recommendation 1)\nThe Assistant Secretary of DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management  should track original milestone dates as well as changes to its cleanup  milestones. (Recommendation 2)\nThe Assistant Secretary of DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management  should comply with the requirements in the National Defense  Authorization Act by reporting annually to Congress on the status of its  cleanup milestones and including a complete list of cleanup milestones  for all sites required by the act. The annual reports should also include,  for each milestone, the original date along with the currently negotiated  date. (Recommendation 3)\nThe Assistant Secretary of DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management  should conduct root cause analyses of missed or postponed milestones.  (Recommendation 4)\n\n\tAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\n\nWe provided a draft of this report to DOE for review and comment. DOE  provided written comments, which are reproduced in appendix II; the  agency also provided technical comments that we incorporated in the  report as appropriate. Of the four recommendations in the report, DOE  agreed with three, and partially agreed with one.\nRegarding the recommendation that DOE update EM\u2019s policies and  procedures to establish a standard definition of milestones and  specify requirements for both including and updating information on  milestones across the complex, the agency agreed with the  recommendation. DOE stated that these policy-driven reforms can  improve the efficiency of milestone tracking.\nRegarding the recommendation that DOE track changes to cleanup  milestones, the agency agreed with the recommendation. DOE stated  that EM currently monitors milestone status, including changes as the  need for changes are identified and as part of its ongoing  communication with field offices, and therefore DOE considers the  recommendation to be closed. However, as we noted in the report,  neither EM headquarters nor the sites track the original baseline  schedule for renegotiated milestone dates. We adjusted the language  of the recommendation to make clear that the EM Assistant Secretary  should track original milestone dates as well as changes to cleanup  milestones. DOE stated in its written comments that EM does not  believe that tracking original and changed milestones will strengthen  EM's ability to use milestones to manage and measure the  performance of its cleanup program. However, as we noted in this  report, according to best practices identified in GAO's schedule  assessment guide, agencies should formally establish a baseline  schedule against which performance can be measured. We have  found that, without a documented and consistently-applied schedule  change control process, program staff may continually revise the  schedule to match performance, hindering management's insight into  the true performance of the project. In addition, DOE's internal project  management policies call for steps to maintain a change control  process, including setting a baseline schedule for completing certain  activities and maintaining a record of any subsequent deviations from  that baseline.\nRegarding our recommendation that DOE comply with the  requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act by reporting  annually to Congress on the status of its cleanup milestones and  including a complete list of cleanup milestones for all sites required by  the act, the agency partially agreed with the recommendation. DOE  stated that additional budget and clarification of purpose and scope  would be required to fulfill this recommendation. As we point out in our  report, DOE has not fully complied with requirements established by  the act, including not submitting all required annual reports and, even  when DOE did submit these reports, its reporting omitted information  about some sites. DOE stated that EM is reviewing options to address  this recommendation.\nRegarding our recommendation that DOE conduct root cause  analyses of performance shortcomings that lead to missed or  postponed milestones, the agency agreed with the recommendation  and stated that EM is evaluating options to implement it. However,  DOE stated that there may be multiple reasons why milestones are  changed, and not all of the changes are due to DOE performance. To  acknowledge the uncertainty in the causes of missed or postponed  milestones, we adjusted the language of the recommendation to  clarify that the EM Assistant Secretary should conduct root cause  analyses of missed or postponed milestones.\nIn addition, in its written comments, DOE disagreed with the draft report's  description of the process and authorities related to renegotiating  compliance milestones, stating that EM cannot and does not unilaterally  delay/postpone milestones and that EPA and state regulator approval of  milestone changes is required. We agree, and the report states that it is  common for regulators and sites to renegotiate milestones before sites  miss them. DOE also disagreed with the draft report\u2019s characterization of  the coordination between EM sites and headquarters in tracking  milestones. In particular, DOE\u2019s written comments state that site-specific  databases include all regulatory compliance milestones drawn from  applicable agreements, while the headquarters database tracks major  enforceable milestones. However, as our report notes, because not all  sites make the same distinction between major and non-major  milestones, sites are not consistently reporting the same types of  milestones to EM headquarters. In addition, DOE\u2019s written comments  state that EM sites and headquarters routinely collaborate and discuss  the status of milestones via meetings and EM periodically requests that  sites verify the data in the EM headquarters database. Nevertheless, as  our report notes, EM requirements governing the submission of milestone  information do not specify when or how often sites are to update this  information.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Energy, and other interested parties.

Formerly Camp Upton, a U.S. Army  installation site, Brookhaven is located on a 5,263-acre site on Long  Island in Upton, NY, approximately 60 miles east of New York City.  Historically, Brookhaven was involved in the construction of accelerators  and research reactors such as the Cosmotron, the High Flux Beam  Reactor, and the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor. These  accelerators and reactors led the way in high-energy physics experiments  and subsequent discoveries but also resulted in radioactive waste. To  complete the cleanup mission, DOE is working to build and operate  groundwater treatment plants, decontaminate and decommission the  High Flux Beam Reactor and the Brookhaven Graphite Research  Reactor, and dispose of some wastes off-site.\n\n\tEnergy Technology Engineering Center\n\nThe Energy Technology Engineering Center occupies 90 acres within the  290 acre Santa Susana Field Laboratory 30 miles north of Los Angeles,  California. The area was primarily used for DOE research and  development activities. In the mid-1950s, part of the area was set aside  for nuclear reactor development and testing, primarily related to the  development of nuclear power plants and space power systems, using  sodium and potassium as coolants. In the mid-1960s, the Energy  Technology Engineering Center was established as a DOE laboratory for  the development of liquid metal heat transfer systems to support the  Office of Nuclear Energy Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor program.  DOE is now involved in the deactivation, decommissioning, and  dismantlement of contaminated facilities on the site.\n\n\tHanford Site\n\nDOE is responsible for one of the world\u2019s largest environmental cleanup  projects: the treatment and disposal of millions of gallons of radioactive  and hazardous waste at its 586 square mile Hanford Site in southeastern  Washington State. Hanford facilities produced more than 20 million  pieces of uranium metal fuel for nine nuclear reactors along the Columbia  River. Five plants in the center of the Hanford Site processed 110,000  tons of fuel from the reactors, discharging an estimated 450 billion gallons  of liquids to soil disposal sites and 53 million gallons of radioactive waste  to 177 large underground tanks. Plutonium production ended in the late  1980s. Hanford cleanup began in 1989 and now involves (1) groundwater  monitoring and treatment, (2) deactivation and decommissioning of  contaminated facilities, and (3) the construction of the waste treatment  and immobilization plant intended, when complete, to treat the waste in  the underground tanks.\n\n\tIdaho National Laboratory\n\nDOE\u2019s Idaho Site is an 890-square-mile federal reserve, situated in the  Arco Desert over the Snake River Plain Aquifer in central Idaho. The  Idaho Cleanup Project involves the environmental cleanup of the Idaho  Site, contaminated with legacy wastes generated from World War II-era  conventional weapons testing, government-owned research and defense  reactors, spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, laboratory research, and  defense missions at other DOE sites.\n\n\tLawrence Livermore National Laboratory\n\nThe 1-square-mile Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory site is an  active, multi-program DOE research laboratory about 45 miles east of  San Francisco. A number of research and support operations at  Lawrence Livermore handle, generate, or manage hazardous materials  that include radioactive wastes. The site first was used as a Naval Air  Station in the 1940s. In 1951, it was transferred to the U.S. Atomic  Energy Commission and was established as a nuclear weapons and  magnetic fusion energy research facility. Over the past several years,  Lawrence Livermore constructed several treatment plants for  groundwater pumping and treatment and for soil vapor extraction. These  systems will continue to operate until cleanup standards are achieved.\n\n\tLos Alamos National Laboratory\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory is located in Los Alamos County in north  central New Mexico. The laboratory, founded in 1943 during World War II,  served as a secret facility for research and development of the first  nuclear weapon. The site was chosen because the area provided  controlled access, steep canyons for testing high explosives, and existing  infrastructure. The Manhattan Project\u2019s research and development efforts  that were previously spread throughout the nation became centralized at  Los Alamos and left a legacy of contamination. Today, the Los Alamos  National Laboratory Cleanup Project is responsible for the treatment,  storage, and disposition of a variety of radioactive and hazardous waste  streams; removal and disposition of buried waste; protection of the  regional aquifer; and removal or deactivation of unneeded facilities.\n\n\tMoab Uranium Mill Tailings Project\n\nThe Moab Site is located about 3 miles northwest of the city of Moab in  Grand County, Utah. The former mill site encompasses approximately  435 acres, of which about 130 acres is covered by the uranium mill  tailings pile. Uranium concentrate (called yellowcake), the milling product,  was sold to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission through December 1970  for use in national defense programs. After 1970, production was  primarily for commercial sales to nuclear power plants. During its years of  operation, the mill processed an average of about 1,400 tons of ore a  day. The milling operations created process-related wastes and tailings, a  radioactive sand-like material. The tailings were pumped to an unlined  impoundment in the western portion of the Moab Site property that  accumulated over time, forming a pile more than 80 feet thick. The  tailings, particularly in the center of the pile, have a high water content.  Excess water in the pile drains into underlying soils, contaminating the  ground water.\n\n\tNevada National Security Site\n\nIn 1950, President Truman established what is now known as the Nevada  National Security Site in Mercury, Nevada, to perform nuclear weapons  testing activities. In support of national defense initiatives, a total of 928  atmospheric and underground nuclear weapons tests were conducted at  the site between 1951 and 1992, when a moratorium on nuclear testing  went into effect. Today, the site is a large, geographically-diverse  research, evaluation, and development complex that supports homeland  security, national defense, and nuclear nonproliferation. In Nevada, DOE  activities focus on groundwater, soil, and on-site facilities; radioactive,  hazardous, and sanitary waste management and disposal; and  environmental planning.\n\n\tOak Ridge Reservation\n\nDOE\u2019s Oak Ridge Reservation is located on approximately 33,500 acres  in eastern Tennessee. The reservation was established in the early 1940s  by the Manhattan Engineer District of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers  and played a role in the production of enriched uranium during the  Manhattan Project and the Cold War. DOE is now working to address  excess and contaminated facilities, remove soil and groundwater  contamination, and enable modernization that allows the National Nuclear  Security Administration to continue its national security and nuclear  nonproliferation responsibilities and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to  continue its mission for advancing technology and science.\n\n\tPaducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant\n\nThe Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, located within an approximately  650-acre fenced security area in in McCracken County in western  Kentucky, opened in 1952 and played a role in the production of enriched  uranium during and after the Cold War until ceasing production for  commercial reactor fuel purposes in 2013. Decades of uranium  enrichment and support activities required the use of a number of typical  and special industrial chemicals and materials. Plant operations  generated hazardous, radioactive, mixed (both hazardous and  radioactive), and nonchemical (sanitary) wastes. Past operations also  resulted in soil, groundwater, and surface water contamination at several  sites located within plant boundaries.\n\n\tPortsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant\n\nThe Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant is located in Pike County, Ohio,  in southern central Ohio, approximately 20 miles north of the city of  Portsmouth, Ohio. Like the Paducah Plant, this facility was also initially  constructed to produce enriched uranium to support the nation\u2019s nuclear  weapons program and was later used by commercial nuclear reactors.  Cleanup activities here are similar to those at the Paducah Plant.\n\n\tSandia National Laboratories\n\nThe Sandia National Laboratories comprises 2,820 acres within the  boundaries of the 118 square miles of Kirtland Air Force Base and is  located about 6 miles east of downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is  managed by the National Nuclear Security Administration. Sandia  National Laboratories was established in 1945 for nuclear weapons  development, testing, and assembly for the Manhattan Engineering  District. Beginning in 1980, the mission shifted toward research and  development for nonnuclear components of nuclear weapons.  Subsequently, the mission was expanded to research and development  on nuclear safeguards and security and multiple areas in science and  technology.\n\n\tSavannah River Site\n\nThe Savannah River Site complex covers 198,344 acres, or 310 square  miles, encompassing parts of Aiken, Barnwell, and Allendale counties in  South Carolina, bordering the Savannah River. The site is a key DOE  industrial complex responsible for environmental stewardship,  environmental cleanup, waste management, and disposition of nuclear  materials. During the early 1950s, the site began to produce materials  used in nuclear weapons, primarily tritium and plutonium-239. Five  reactors were built to produce nuclear materials and resulted in unusable  by-products, such as radioactive waste. About 35 million gallons of  radioactive liquid waste are stored in 43 underground tanks. The Defense  Waste Processing Facility is processing the high-activity waste,  encapsulating radioactive elements in borosilicate glass, a stable storage  form. Since the facility began operations in March 1996, it has produced  more than 4,000 canisters (more than 16 million pounds) of radioactive  glass.\n\n\tSeparations Process Research Unit\n\nThe Separations Process Research Unit is an inactive facility located at  the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in Niskayuna, New York, near  Schenectady. The Mohawk River forms the northern boundary of this site.  Built in the late 1940s, its mission was to research the chemical process  to extract plutonium from irradiated materials. Equipment was flushed and  drained, and bulk waste was removed following the shutdown of the  facilities in 1953. Today, process vessels and piping have been removed  from all the research unit\u2019s facilities. In 2010, cleanup of radioactivity and  chemical contamination in the Lower Level Railroad Staging Area, Lower  Level Parking Lot, and North Field areas was completed.\n\n\tWaste Isolation Pilot Plant\n\nThe Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is an underground repository located near  Carlsbad, New Mexico, that is used for disposing of defense transuranic  waste. The plant is managed by DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental  Management and is the only deep geological repository for the permanent  disposal of defense generated transuranic waste.\n\n\tWest Valley Demonstration Project\n\nThe West Valley Demonstration Project occupies approximately 200  acres within the 3,345 acres of land called the Western New York Nuclear  Service Center. The project is located approximately 40 miles south of  Buffalo, New York. The West Valley Demonstration Project Act of 1980  established the project. The act directed DOE to solidify and dispose of  the high-level waste and decontaminate and decommission the facilities  used in the process. The land and facilities are not owned by DOE.  Rather, the project premises are the property of the New York State  Energy Research and Development Authority. DOE does not have  access to the entire 3,345 acres of property.\n\nAppendix II: Comments from the Department of Energy\n\nAppendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\n\n\tGAO Contact\n\n\tStaff Acknowledgments\n\nIn addition to the contact named above, Nico Sloss (Assistant Director),  Jeffrey T. Larson (Analyst in Charge), Natalie M. Block, Antoinette C.  Capaccio, R. Scott Fletcher, Cindy K. Gilbert, Richard P. Johnson, Jeffrey  R. Rueckhaus, Ilga Semeiks, Sheryl E. Stein, and Joshua G. Wiener  made key contributions to this report.\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "Why GAO Did This Study\n\nEM manages DOE's radioactive and hazardous waste cleanup program using compliance agreements negotiated between DOE and other federal and state agencies. Within the agreements, milestones outline cleanup work to be accomplished by specific deadlines. EM's cleanup program faces nearly $500 billion in future environmental liability, which has grown substantially.\nGAO was asked to review DOE's cleanup agreements. This report examines the extent to which EM (1) tracks the milestones in cleanup agreements for EM's cleanup sites; (2) has met, missed, or postponed cleanup-related milestones at selected sites and how EM reports information; and (3) has analyzed why milestones are missed or postponed and how EM considers those reasons when renegotiating milestones.\nGAO reviewed agreements and milestones at EM's 16 cleanup sites and compared information tracked by EM headquarters and these sites; interviewed officials from four selected sites (chosen for variation in location and scope of cleanup, among other factors); and reviewed EM guidance related to milestone negotiations.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nThe cleanup process at the 16 sites overseen by the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) is governed by 72 agreements and hundreds of milestones specifying actions EM is to take as it carries out its cleanup work. However, EM headquarters and site officials do not consistently track data on the milestones. EM headquarters and site officials provided GAO with different totals on the number of milestones in place at the four sites GAO selected for review. These discrepancies result from how headquarters and selected sites define and track milestones. First, not all sites make the same distinction between major (i.e., related to on-the-ground cleanup) and non-major milestones and, as a result, are not consistently reporting the same milestones to EM headquarters. Second, sites do not consistently provide EM headquarters with the most up-to-date information on the status of milestones at each site. These inconsistencies limit EM's ability to use milestones to manage the cleanup mission and monitor its progress.\nEM does not accurately track met, missed, or postponed cleanup-related milestones at the four selected sites, and EM's milestone reporting to Congress is incomplete. EM sites renegotiate milestone dates before they are missed, and EM does not track the history of these changes. This is because once milestones change, sites are not required to maintain or track the original milestone dates. GAO has previously found that without a documented and consistently-applied schedule change control process, program staff may continually revise the schedule to match performance, hindering management's insight into the true performance of the project. Further, since 2011, EM has not consistently reported to Congress on the status of the milestones each year, as required, and the information it has reported is incomplete. EM reports the most recently renegotiated milestone dates with no indication of whether or how often those milestones have been missed or postponed. Since neither EM headquarters nor the sites track renegotiated milestones and their baseline dates at the sites, milestones do not provide a reliable measure of program performance.\nEM officials at headquarters and selected sites have not conducted root cause analyses on missed or postponed milestones; thus, such analyses are not part of milestone negotiations. Specifically, EM has not done a complex-wide analysis of the reasons for missed or postponed milestones. Similarly, officials GAO interviewed at the four selected sites said that they were not aware of any site-wide review of why milestones were missed or postponed. Best practices for project and program management outlined in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide note the importance of identifying root causes of problems that lead to schedule delays. Additionally, in a 2015 directive, DOE emphasized the importance of conducting such analysis. Analyzing the root causes of missed or postponed milestones would better position EM to address systemic problems and consider those problems when renegotiating milestones with regulators. Without such analysis, EM and its cleanup regulators lack information to set more realistic and achievable milestones and, as a result, future milestones are likely to continue to be pushed back, further delaying the cleanup work. As GAO has reported previously, these delays lead to increases in the overall cost of the cleanup.\n\nWhat GAO Recommends\n\nGAO is making four recommendations, including that EM establish a standard definition of milestones across the cleanup sites, track and report original and renegotiated milestone dates, and identify the root causes of why milestones are missed or postponed. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOE agreed with three of the recommendations and partially agreed with a fourth.",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBackground\n\n\t\tUI Program Administration and Funding\n\nThe federal-state UI program provides temporary cash benefits to eligible  workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. Under this  arrangement, states administer their own programs according to certain  federal requirements and under the oversight of DOL\u2019s Office of  Unemployment Insurance. States have considerable flexibility to set  benefit amounts and their duration, or the maximum period of time that  the state pays benefits, and establish eligibility requirements.\nUI benefits are funded primarily through state payroll taxes on employers,  and administrative costs are primarily funded through a federal payroll tax  on employers. The states collect taxes that will be used to pay UI  benefits, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury holds these funds in  trust on behalf of the states in the Unemployment Trust Fund. DOL  certifies for payment to the states administrative grants to operate their UI  programs, which amounted to about $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2017. DOL  is responsible for ensuring that state UI laws include certain provisions,  which is a condition of the state receiving its UI administrative grant.\nIndividuals typically claim their UI benefits by filing claims with their state  UI agency online or by phone on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. In fiscal  year 2017, the average weekly UI benefit was about $350, and claimants  remained on the program for an average of 15 weeks, according to DOL  data.\n\n\t\tWork Search Requirements for UI Claimants\n\nFederal law establishes a work search requirement for UI eligibility, but  the specific work search activities UI claimants are expected to conduct  vary by state, according to a DOL report. To be eligible for  unemployment benefits, individuals are generally required to actively  search for work under federal law. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job  Creation Act of 2012 amended the Social Security Act to, among other  things, require states to have work search requirements for UI claimants  specified in their laws as a condition of eligibility for the states\u2019 UI  administrative grants. Specifically, states must have laws that require UI  claimants to be \u201cactively seeking work\u201d as a condition of eligibility for  unemployment compensation for any week. Because federal law does not  specifically define actively seeking work, states have some discretion to  establish a reasonable definition, according to DOL\u2019s 2013 guidance to  states. For example, a state can specify a minimum number of weekly  contacts a claimant must have with potential employers. Acceptable work  search activities might also include searching for jobs online, submitting  job applications, visiting a job center, attending a networking event, or  establishing a LinkedIn account, according to a DOL report.\nDepending on the state, UI claimants may be directed to register for work  with their state\u2019s Employment Service, which provides job search  assistance, job placement assistance, and referrals to employers. In  addition, in some cases UI claimants may be directed to participate in  reemployment services at an American Job Center. In 2017, DOL  provided $115 million in grants to states to provide Reemployment  Services and Eligibility Assessments (RESEA). RESEA services include  in-person reemployment services and eligibility assessments in American  Job Centers for ex-service members and UI claimants determined to have  a high likelihood of exhausting their UI benefits. RESEA-funded activities  include developing an individual reemployment plan, providing labor  market information, identifying job skills and prospects, and reviewing the  claimant\u2019s continued eligibility for UI benefits.\n\n\t\tProcess for Identifying Work Search Overpayments in State Benefit Accuracy Measurement Audits\n\nDOL uses its Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) system to determine  the accuracy of UI benefit payments and estimate the amount and rate of  improper payments. Under the BAM system, each state reviews a  number of randomly selected cases on a weekly basis and reconstructs  the UI claims process to assess the accuracy of the payments that were  made. The state determines what the benefit payment should have  been according to its laws and policies. States report the results of their  BAM case reviews to DOL\u2014including overpayments and  underpayments\u2014through an online data system. DOL uses the data to  estimate improper payment rates by state, as well as to calculate a  nationwide rate.\nState BAM audits involve reviews of existing records in the state\u2019s UI  claims information system as well as original fact-finding by the state  BAM investigator. DOL requires states to use a standard claimant  questionnaire when conducting BAM audits. The questionnaire includes  numerous questions about the claimant\u2019s circumstances\u2014including their  work search efforts\u2014during the week under review. The questionnaire  includes questions that could indicate that a claimant qualifies for an  exemption from work search requirements, or made specific job contacts  and the results of the job contacts, such as whether the claimant  submitted an application and received a job offer.\nState BAM investigators are also expected to take steps to verify the  information reported by the claimant by collecting documentation from  claimants and contacting employers or other third parties. According to  DOL\u2019s 2016 BAM annual report and BAM procedures, state BAM  investigators are to review a sufficient number of work search activities to  determine whether the claimant has complied with the state\u2019s minimum  requirement for the number of weekly work search activities. The BAM  program assigns one of three classifications to each of the work search  activities reviewed:\nAcceptable \u2013 Documentation exists that the work search activity  reported by the claimant, such as an employer contact, employment  application, or other state approved work search activity, was made  by the claimant and was acceptable according to the state\u2019s law or  policy.\nUnverifiable \u2013 The investigator was unable to establish sufficient  information to make a judgment of whether the work search activity  was either acceptable or unacceptable according to the state\u2019s law or  policy.\nUnacceptable \u2013 Written documentation exists that the work search  activity reported by the claimant was not made at all by claimant, or  was made but was unacceptable according to the state\u2019s law or  policy.\nAccording to DOL\u2019s BAM annual report, work search activities classified  as acceptable or unverifiable may be considered in calculating whether  the claimant has satisfied the state\u2019s required number of work search  activities for purposes of BAM. If the state investigator finds that the  claimant\u2019s work search is unacceptable and does not meet the state\u2019s  requirements, he or she may determine the claimant was ineligible for  benefits and establish an overpayment, depending on state law (see fig.  1). Currently, several states have formal warning policies and provide  claimants warnings for the first instance of noncompliance with work  search requirements, whereas states without these policies count these  cases as overpayments, according to DOL.\n\n\t\tReported Causes of UI Improper Payments\n\nSince 2002, federal agencies have been required to identify and report  improper payments. The leading reported cause of UI improper  payments in fiscal year 2017 was overpayments to claimants who failed  to meet work search requirements. DOL data show that states made an  estimated $1.36 billion in overpayments to such claimants in fiscal year  2017. Other major reported causes of UI improper payments in fiscal year  2017 included payments made to individuals who continue to make  claims even after returning to work (benefit year earnings) and payments  made to claimants who were determined ineligible due to disqualifying job  separations, such as quitting a job without good cause or being  discharged for misconduct (separation issues). (See fig. 2. Table 8 in app.  II provides greater detail.)\nAccording to DOL officials, many UI improper payments cannot be  prevented given certain legal requirements that states pay claims in a  timely manner and provide claimants with due process when the state  finds an eligibility issue. Specifically, according to DOL, federal law  requires that when an eligibility issue is detected, the claimant has a right  to receive notice and provide the state information before being denied  benefits. In addition, if an eligibility issue associated with work search,  or any other matter, is detected but not resolved, the state is still required  to pay for a claimed week no later than the week after an eligibility issue  is detected, according to DOL. The time it takes to work through the  necessary due process steps can prevent states from stopping the  payment before it must be paid.\n\n\t\tTrend in Reported Work Search Overpayments\n\nNationally, the estimated work search overpayment rate and the  estimated amount of work search overpayments have risen in recent  years. Specifically, in fiscal year 2013, approximately $1 billion in  estimated work search overpayments were made to claimants who were  not actively searching for work and, in fiscal year 2017, the amount  increased to close to an estimated $1.36 billion (see fig. 3). The national  work search overpayment rate for such claimants also increased during  this time. (See table 9 in app. II for additional details.) According to DOL  officials, some states implemented more stringent work search  requirements, which may account for the recent trend. As work search  requirements become more stringent, the opportunities for non- compliance and errors increase and thus higher improper payment rates,  according to DOL officials. While the national work search overpayment  rate was 4.5 percent in fiscal year 2017, state work search overpayment  rates varied widely from an estimated 0 to 41 percent of the UI benefits  that states paid in fiscal year 2017. (See table 10 in app. II for state-by- state estimates of work search overpayment rates and amounts.)\nStates use various methods to recover overpayments to UI claimants,  including setting up payment plans, off-setting UI benefits, or deducting  refunds from federal or state income tax returns. Like all recovered UI  overpayments, recoveries of work search overpayments must be  deposited in the unemployment trust fund of the state that recovered the  money and can be used only for the payment of UI benefits, according to  DOL officials. National data are not available on the amount of work  search overpayments that states have recovered because, although DOL  collects recovery data from states, it does not require states to separate  out work search overpayment recoveries from other types of recoveries in  their reporting.\n\n\tConducting More Work Search Investigations Is Associated With Lower Estimated Work Search Overpayment Rates, As Is the Use of Formal Warnings\n\nBased on our analysis of DOL data, we found that certain state  administrative practices, including investigating a higher percentage of  claimant-reported work search activities and frequent use of formal  warnings, were associated with lower reported state work search  overpayment rates. However, DOL recently determined that federal law  does not permit states to warn claimants the first time they failed to meet  work search requirements (i.e., issue formal warnings) instead of  establishing that an overpayment was made. Additionally, a higher  percentage of claimants required to search for work is associated with  higher reported state work search overpayment rates.\n\n\t\tInvestigating Claimant- Reported Job Contacts Is Associated with Lower Work Search Overpayment Estimates, but the Extent to Which States Verified Contacts Varied\n\nOne of the administrative practices significantly associated with lower  work search overpayment estimates was investigations of claimants\u2019  reported job contacts. Specifically, a higher percentage of cases with  claimants whose contacts were investigated by the state UI agency as  part of the state\u2019s BAM audit was associated with a lower work search  overpayment rate estimate. According to our analysis, for every 1  percentage point increase in the percentage of cases with claimants\u2019  whose job contacts were investigated, there was a 0.072 percentage  point decrease in the work search overpayment rate estimate.\nThe extent to which states attempted to verify claimants\u2019 reported job  contacts through these investigations varied, according to our analysis of  DOL data. Nationally, in fiscal year 2017, states investigated job contacts  in about 80 percent of BAM cases where claimants were required to  search for work. However, among the states, the proportion of cases in  which job contacts were investigated was less than 50 percent in 5  states. (Table 11 in app. II shows the percentage of contacts that were  investigated for each state.)\nFurthermore, states often were not able to verify the information claimants  reported. Of the job contacts that were investigated, states reported that  about 48 percent of the job contacts were acceptable, about 8 percent  were unacceptable, and about 45 percent could not be verified (see fig.  5).\nOur analysis of BAM data for fiscal year 2017 also shows that for the  overpayments that states were able to detect, that a large portion were  found through investigating and verifying claimants\u2019 work search contacts.  Specifically, 47 percent of reported work search overpayments were  found through this practice. Interviewing claimants about their work  search was the next most common way states detected work search  overpayments. States reported identifying 32 percent of work search  overpayments in fiscal year 2017 using this practice.\nAlthough overpayments can be the result of actions taken by the claimant  or the agency administering the program, states reported that most work  search overpayments are associated with claimants. For example,  claimants may provide inadequate or incorrect information needed by the  UI agency to determine if the claimant met work search requirements. In  fiscal year 2017, states attributed about 99 percent of overpayments at  least partially to claimant action, while they attributed about 2 percent at  least partially to administrative errors at the state agency.\n\n\t\tFrequent Use of Formal Warnings Is Associated with Reporting Lower Work Search Overpayments, but DOL Recently Determined Their Use Is Legally Impermissible\n\nAccording to DOL data, 22 states issued formal warnings to one or more  claimants at some point between fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2017 for  failure to meet work search requirements instead of finding that the  claimants were overpaid. Although the states that made use of these  warnings varied over this period, the number of states issuing formal  warnings has generally increased over time from 13 states issuing formal  warnings in fiscal year 2013 to 19 states in fiscal year 2017. Overall,  states that most frequently issued formal warnings had lower reported  work search overpayment rates than states that did not issue formal  warnings. However, their work search overpayment rates are lower  because, under their state policies, they did not count an overpayment  when they issued a formal warning.\nOur analysis indicates that states which issued formal warnings  frequently\u2014in 75 percent or more of cases involving work search errors\u2014 had estimated work search overpayment rates that were 3.5 percentage  points lower, on average, than states that did not issue formal warnings.  However, states that use formal warnings less frequently\u2014in fewer than  75 percent of cases involving work search errors\u2014reported work search  overpayment rates that were between 3 and 4 percentage points higher  than states that did not issue formal warnings. See appendix I for a  detailed discussion of our econometric analysis.\nTable 1 shows the average work search overpayment rate estimates for  each of these groups of states when formal warnings are not counted as  overpayments, and the potential average work search overpayment rate  when formal warnings are counted as overpayments. Excluding formal  warnings, two of the groups\u2014frequent and low users of formal  warnings\u2014had average work search overpayment rate estimates lower  than the average for states that did not use formal warnings. However,  when formal warnings are included in the overpayment rate, only low  users of formal warnings have a work search overpayment rate estimate  lower than the average for states that did not use formal warnings.\nGAO\u2019s analysis of DOL data shows that in fiscal year 2017, estimated  work search overpayments were nearly $1.4 billion, but potentially would  have been an estimated $1.8 billion greater if states had not issued  formal warnings and established overpayments. Our analysis further  shows that if formal warning cases had been included in DOL\u2019s  calculation of the UI overpayment rates for fiscal year 2017, the  nationwide UI overpayment rate would have increased by about 6  percentage points, from an estimated 12 percent to an estimated 18  percent. Moreover, these figures represent an increase from the fiscal  year 2016 figures we presented in our previous report on states\u2019 use of  formal warnings related to work search requirements. At that time, we  found the nationwide UI overpayment rate would have increased by about  5 percentage points from an estimated 11 percent to an estimated 16  percent with the inclusion of formal warning cases. The amount of UI  payments made to claimants for weeks in which they received formal  warnings in fiscal year 2016 was about $1.6 billion. Table 12 in appendix  II shows how the estimated UI overpayment rate in each state issuing  formal warnings in fiscal year 2017 may have increased if formal  warnings were not used.\nState use of formal warnings has resulted in inconsistent reporting of  work search overpayments, which affects DOL\u2019s reported improper  payment rate for the UI program. Specifically, states that issue formal  warnings have not counted as overpayments cases in which claimants  did not actively search for work and received a UI benefit payment. On  the other hand, states that did not have formal warning policies counted  such cases as overpayments, which are factored into DOL\u2019s reported  improper payments rate. The variation among states related to formal  warning policies makes it difficult for DOL and others to understand the  reasons behind states\u2019 reported work search overpayments.\nDOL has determined and documented in its FY 2017 Agency Financial  Report that the use of formal warnings is no longer allowed under the  2012 federal law, which generally requires UI claimants to actively seek  work. DOL officials told us in July 2017 they would soon issue a letter to  states to inform them that they are no longer permitted to use formal  warnings when they determine that claimants failed to meet work search  requirements. To date, DOL has not issued such a letter. In May 2018,  DOL officials told us that they expect to issue the letter by the end of  calendar year 2018. Federal internal control standards direct agency  management to remediate identified internal control deficiencies on a  timely basis. Federal internal controls standards also state that  management should externally communicate the necessary quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. Additionally, these  standards state that agency management should establish and operate  monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate  the results.\nAccording to DOL officials, they began discussing the need for a potential  discontinuation of formal warnings at conferences with states in the first  half of 2017. However, we found that states continued to implement their  formal warning policies, potentially resulting in an increase in the  estimated amounts of overpayment dollars associated with formal  warnings between fiscal year 2016 and 2017. Until DOL informs states of  the need to discontinue the use of formal warnings through a letter or  another mechanism, states will continue to be inconsistent in whether  they count as overpayments cases in which claimants who failed to  search for work in any week were provided benefits. Additionally, once  DOL provides additional information to states on formal warnings, it  should monitor states\u2019 responses to help ensure that DOL achieves its  desired results. Furthermore, having more consistent information on  overpayments related to work search issues could help DOL assess how  the program is working nationwide and whether further federal and state  actions would be needed to address this leading source of reported  improper payments in the UI program.\nDOL officials stated that the national work search overpayment rate is  likely to increase in the future as states begin to eliminate their formal  warning practices. Officials also stated that this may take some time as  some states may need to amend laws or regulations in order to do so.\n\n\t\tHigher Percentages of Claimants Required to Search for Work Are Associated with Higher Work Search Overpayment Rate Estimates\n\nState work search overpayment rate estimates were higher for states  where a higher proportion of claimants were required to search for work.  Based on our analysis, for every one percentage point increase in the  fraction of cases with claimants required to search for work, there was a  0.084 percentage point increase in the work search overpayment rate  estimate on average, all else being equal.\nNationwide in fiscal year 2017, states reported that work searches have  been required in 80 percent of cases, with requirements in individual  states ranging from 38 to 100 percent of cases. Three states reported  requiring fewer than 50 percent of claimants to perform work searches,  while five states reported requiring more than 95 percent of their  claimants to perform work searches. The most common reasons states  exempted claimants from work searches were because claimants were  \u201cjob-attached\u201d (e.g. temporarily laid-off, recalled), or they had union  deferrals because they were seeking employment through their union,  according to DOL data. The map in figure 6 shows the range among all  the states in the percentage of UI claimants required to search for work,  according to our analysis of DOL data for fiscal year 2017.\n\n\tSelected States Used Multiple Approaches to Address Work Search Overpayments, but Cited Challenges Verifying Claimants\u2019 Work Search Activities\n\nSelected states used multiple approaches to address work search  overpayments, including online systems to facilitate the work search  reporting and verification process, work search audits beyond the BAM  audits, and messaging to inform claimants of their work search  responsibilities. For example, three of six states in our review had online  systems where claimants could report specific work search activities as  part of filing their weekly claims, according to state officials (see table  2). Some of the approaches states used were specifically designed for  UI claimants participating in state reemployment programs.\nState officials cited several benefits of the approaches they use to  address work search overpayments. The online systems, work search  audits, and messaging helped prompt work search activities and prevent  work search overpayments in some cases, according to state officials.  According to officials from the selected states that used them and a study  on work search improper payments, online systems can facilitate the work  search reporting and verification in several ways:\nAutomatically documenting the claimants\u2019 work search activities.\nOnline reporting of work search activities can help prevent  overpayments because their work search is documented in the online  claims system, which means the claimant does not need to keep a  work search log. In addition, online job search/training systems can  be used to track the work search activities completed by claimants,  making it easier for the state to verify that the work search was  completed. For example, officials in Mississippi and Indiana told us  they piloted an online system called NextJob and required RESEA  program participants to conduct work search activities through the  system. Mississippi officials reported that NextJob motivated  claimants to conduct their job search and increased the speed of  reemployment among these individuals. Similarly, New Jersey officials  told us that UI claimants selected to participate in New Jersey\u2019s  RESEA program are required to use an online job search and training  system called OnRamp, which, for example, allows job seekers to  create or upload their resume on the website, search for jobs, access  online training, and receive email alerts on potential job matches. In  addition, officials in Nevada said that the online reporting system is  beneficial because the work search activities are documented in the  system and are more reliably retrieved if the claimant is selected for a  BAM audit because few claimants maintain and retain their work  search effort logs.\nPerforming automated checks on data the claimants submit. The  online claims systems can identify potentially duplicate job contacts  and check whether the claimant reported the required number of job  contacts. For example, Utah officials reported that if a claimant enters  job contacts from another week, officials would follow up with the  claimant by phone after it is flagged by their online system. If  claimants report self-disqualifying information, such as an insufficient  number of job contacts, the system can automatically put a hold on a  claim until the issue is resolved.\nFacilitating communication with the claimant. Some states added  messages to their online claims system that pop up if the claimant  enters incorrect or insufficient information. For example, Mississippi  officials stated that they used messaging to better inform claimants of  their responsibilities and to encourage them to report accurate  information. According to the officials, if claimants do not report the  required number of work search activities in the online system, a  questionnaire will pop up requesting that the claimants explain why  they did not do so. The system requires the claimants to enter more  information in order to submit their claims and to receive their benefit  payments. Mississippi officials also stated that adding targeted  messaging resulted in fewer denials of benefits due to claimant failure  to meet work search requirements and also reduced the number of  appeals related to this type of denial. Some state officials said that  messaging encouraged accurate reporting. For example, Indiana  officials told us that at the end of the online claim filing process,  claimants receive a message notifying them of the state\u2019s work search  requirements and informing them that they are required to search for  work to continue receiving benefits. In Utah, officials developed a  video that covers claimants\u2019 responsibilities, including work search  requirements, which claimants must view before receiving their initial  benefit payment, according to state officials.\nOfficials in three of the states we reviewed reported using additional work  search audits beyond BAM to help reinforce their state policies.  Pennsylvania officials reported conducting 7,182 work search audits for  RESEA program participants in 2016. As a result, officials reported that  the state issued 1,300 warnings to claimants. The two other states\u2014 Mississippi and Utah\u2014report that their random work search audits,  coupled with their online systems, helped prevent work search  overpayments as they are able to disqualify claims before the payment  goes out. Mississippi and Utah officials also reported that they were also  able to identify and recover some work search overpayments (see table  3).\nDespite implementing these approaches, state officials in five of the six  states we contacted told us they face challenges with verifying work  search activities. These officials stated that they have difficulty verifying  work search activities as some claimants do not understand the work  search requirements or do not keep accurate records of their work search  activities, which makes it difficult for the state to confirm compliance with  the state requirements. In addition, state officials also said that many  employers do not keep records of job seekers\u2019 inquiries or do not respond  to state requests for information when they are trying to verify claimants\u2019  work search activities. For example, Nevada officials said that work  search contacts are often virtually unverifiable as many companies  outsource their hiring processes to contractors who refer the job  candidate for a job posting and keep the job application. Officials said  these contractors also rarely respond to state inquiries about claimants\u2019  job applications. As discussed later, DOL has provided states tools to  help address this issue, such as a messaging toolkit to help states  improve communications with claimants and employers.\n\n\tDOL Monitors States\u2019 Work Search Overpayment Rate Estimates and Provides Assistance, but Lacks Clear Procedures on Work Search Verification\n\n\t\tDOL Monitors States\u2019 Work Search Overpayment Rate Estimates and Has Identified Strategies and Provided Tools to Help States Reduce Their Rates\n\nDOL uses UI performance data to monitor state progress in reducing the  estimated improper payment rate, including data on overpayments to  claimants who failed to meet work search requirements. To do so, DOL  requires states to submit State Quality Service Plans, which serve as the  performance reporting and grant application documents through which  states receive administrative funding. The plans include a summary of  state performance on various measures related to operating the UI  program, including the improper payment rate, according to DOL  documentation we reviewed. States with estimated improper payment  rates of 10 percent or more are required to submit corrective action plans  to DOL. For example, data from two of the six states we reviewed\u2013 Nevada and New Jersey\u2013had estimated improper payment rates above  10 percent during DOL\u2019s most recent planning cycle and developed  corrective action plans. Nevada\u2019s corrective action plan noted that the  state expects their rate to decline due to their June 2017 implementation  of online work search reporting as part of their UI claims system. New  Jersey\u2019s corrective action plan noted that the state plans to implement  new online tools that will help them verify wage and employment  information. DOL separately monitors each state\u2019s estimated work search  overpayment rate. In addition, all states, including those who estimated  improper payment rates of less than 10 percent, are required to prepare a  state-specific action plan that describes the root causes of improper  payments and the state\u2019s strategies to address them. According to  agency officials, DOL reviews plans to monitor state performance and  help states identify strategies to improve performance.\nAlthough DOL requires states with estimated improper payment rates of  10 percent or more to develop corrective action plans, according to DOL,  the agency has limited options to require state UI agencies to take actions  to respond to high improper payment rates. DOL officials told us that,  beyond routine monitoring and providing states with technical assistance  to help reduce their improper payments rate, their enforcement options  are limited to withholding the state\u2019s administrative funding or removing  federal tax credit reductions, which is, in effect, a tax increase for the  state\u2019s employers. According to DOL officials, both are considered  extraordinary sanctions that require significant due process. The agency  has not withheld state administrative funding to address improper  payments, according to DOL officials. DOL officials also told us that they  are concerned about the effects on UI claimants if they were to withhold  administrative funding. The administration\u2019s fiscal year 2019  congressional budget justification includes a legislative proposal that  would authorize the Secretary of Labor to require states to implement  corrective action measures for poor state performance in the UI program,  helping to reduce improper payments in states with the highest estimated  rates.\nDOL has identified strategies to address the leading causes of UI  improper payments\u2014including work search issues\u2014and provided states  tools and funding to help implement them. For example:\nPathway to Reemployment Framework. In 2016, DOL and the  National Association of State Workforce Agencies published a  framework that contained a broad menu of work search options that  states could adopt to better reflect how individuals search for work,  such as allowing use of online job search tools to count as an  approved work search activity. The framework also includes  suggestions for how states could document or verify claimants\u2019 work  search activities for eligibility purposes.\nMessaging toolkit. In 2012, DOL published a messaging toolkit  designed in part to improve claimants\u2019 understanding of work search  requirements as a condition of eligibility for benefits. According to  DOL, claimants who fully understand their responsibilities and the  consequences of not fulfilling them may be more likely to complete the  required work search activities, thereby reducing instances of  claimants\u2019 failing to search for work. DOL provided states  supplemental funding to support improved messaging and tracked  state implementation of the strategies.\nOnline tool to record work search activities. In 2011, DOL  provided supplemental funding to New York to develop an online work  search record that could be replicated by other states. This tool is  designed to reduce improper payments that result from inadequate  documentation of work search activities. Claimants can use the tool to  record their work search online when they file their UI claims. The  work search record is automatically shared with state job centers,  which in turn act to enhance claimants\u2019 work search and connect  claimants with jobs. New York used open source technologies when  designing the tool in an effort to help more states replicate the product  at a lower cost.\nUI Integrity Center. The DOL-funded UI Integrity Center of  Excellence (UI Integrity Center) was established as a way to help  states develop and share innovative strategies to prevent and detect  UI improper payments, reduce fraud, and improve program integrity.  For example, the UI Integrity Center funded a pilot project in 2016 to  support a state in implementing an online tool that trains claimants on  how to effectively search for jobs and allows claimants to use the tool  to complete their work search activities. The UI Integrity Center also  hosted national conferences in 2016 and 2018 that included  presentations on state practices to address work search improper  payments.\n\n\t\tDOL Directs States to Investigate a Sample of Claimants\u2019 Work Searches, but Has Not Clarified Procedures on Verifying Work Search\n\nAlthough DOL monitors states\u2019 work search overpayment rate estimates  and has provided assistance to help states address such overpayments,  it has provided limited direction to states on the level of effort states must  make to verify whether claimants are actively searching for work.  Specifically, DOL\u2019s BAM procedures direct states to investigate a  sufficient number of work search contacts in its BAM sample of UI cases  to determine if the claimants met the state\u2019s work search requirement.  However, DOL has not provided states any additional direction on what is  considered \u201csufficient.\u201d As previously mentioned, the extent to which  states attempted to verify job contacts from claimants\u2019 work searches  varied across states. Some states reported to DOL that they did not  investigate work search activities for a majority of their BAM cases even  though work search was required and the claimant reported job contacts.\nFederal internal control standards state that agency management should  externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve its  objectives, including addressing related risks. According to DOL  officials, the agency plans to clarify its BAM procedures, to include  providing more definitive instructions to states on work search verification  requirements, after the agency issues its planned letter to states about  discontinuing the use of formal warning policies. As of May 2018, the  agency said it plans to issue the letter on formal warning policies by the  end of calendar year 2018. However, as previously stated, it has been  nearly a year since DOL initially told us they were planning to issue the  letter to states.\nEffective monitoring of state compliance with the clarified work search  verification requirements will also be important once DOL revises its BAM  procedures. Federal internal control standards state that agency  management should establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor  the internal control system and evaluate the results. Monitoring states\u2019  responses could help ensure that DOL achieves its desired results. By  providing clear direction to states about work search verification  requirements and monitoring states\u2019 implementation of these  requirements, DOL would have greater assurance that states are  complying with its requirements.\n\n\tConclusions\n\nThe health of the UI program depends, in part, on the ability of states to  control its benefit payments by accurately determining individuals\u2019  eligibility. Improper payments, including overpayments, in the UI program  have led to billions of federal and state funds being used inappropriately.\nActively seeking work has generally been an eligibility requirement for  individuals receiving unemployment benefits under federal law since  2012, but states have not consistently implemented the requirement for  claimants in similar circumstances. States with formal warning policies  reported lower work search overpayments not necessarily because they  are better at ensuring claimants\u2019 compliance with requirements, but  because they are not counting cases where claimants receive formal  warnings as overpayments. Furthermore, although DOL determined in  2017 that states are not permitted to issue formal warnings rather than  reporting an overpayment, it has not officially told states to stop using  warnings. Without providing states with this information and monitoring  their response, states will continue to report inconsistent information on  the extent of work search overpayments.\nState efforts to check whether claimants are meeting work search  requirements also vary. Our evidence suggests that states making a  greater effort to investigate work search activities tend to have lower  overpayment rate estimates associated with this issue. However, some  states are not investigating claimant-reported work search activities as  part of their BAM audits despite DOL\u2019s procedures directing them to do  so. Until DOL provides clear direction to states about verifying work  search and monitors state compliance, DOL has little assurance that  states are complying with its requirements.\n\n\tRecommendations for Executive Action\n\nWe are making the following four recommendations to the Department of  Labor:\nThe Assistant Secretary of DOL\u2019s Employment and Training  Administration should provide states with information about its  determination that the use of state formal warning policies is no longer  permissible under federal law. (Recommendation 1)\nThe Assistant Secretary of DOL\u2019s Employment and Training  Administration should monitor states\u2019 efforts to discontinue the use of  formal warning policies. (Recommendation 2)\nThe Assistant Secretary of DOL\u2019s Employment and Training  Administration should clarify information on work search verification  requirements in its revised Benefit Accuracy Measurement  procedures. The revised procedures should include an explanation of  what DOL considers to be sufficient verification of claimants\u2019 work  search activities. (Recommendation 3)\nThe Assistant Secretary of DOL\u2019s Employment and Training  Administration should monitor states\u2019 compliance with the clarified  work search verification requirements. (Recommendation 4)\n\n\tAgency Comments\n\nWe provided a draft of this report to the Department of Labor (DOL) for  review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix IV,  DOL agreed with all four of our recommendations and stated that it would  take action to address them. DOL also provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate. Additionally, we provided excerpts  of the draft report to state UI officials in the selected six states we  included in our review. We incorporated their technical comments as  appropriate.\nAs agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate  congressional committees, the Secretary of the Department of Labor, and  other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on  the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at 202-512-7215 or brownbarnesc@gao.gov. Contact points for our  Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on  the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this  report are listed in appendix V.\n\nAppendix I: Econometric Analysis of Estimated State Work Search Overpayment Rates\n\n\tData\n\nWe used the Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL) Unemployment Insurance  Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) data. The BAM program is  designed to determine the accuracy of paid and denied claims for  unemployment insurance (UI) in three major UI programs\u2014state UI,  Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE), and  Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX). The BAM  data covers claimants in the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and  Puerto Rico. Each week, state workforce agencies select random  samples of paid and denied unemployment insurance claims (i.e., cases).  State BAM investigators then audit these cases to determine whether the  claimant was properly paid or was properly denied benefits in the week  for which the claim was made (i.e., key week). The bases for determining  whether paid and denied claims were accurate are federal and state law,  regulations, and policy.\nWe used BAM cases for paid claims for all UI programs and all states for  fiscal years 2013 through 2017. The number of cases for each state is  determined by DOL for each year. Cases are chosen randomly each  week from the population of claims for that week. The normal weekly  number of paid claims sampled in most states is 9, with a minimum of 6,  for an annual sample of around 480 cases. For the 10 states with the  smaller UI workloads, the normal weekly number of paid claims sampled  is 7, with a minimum of 5, for an annual sample of around 360 cases.\nFor each paid claim case, the BAM data include variables describing the  claimant, as well as information on their UI benefit year, separation from  their last job, monetary eligibility, benefit payment history, employment  services registration and work search, and the outcome of the BAM  investigation. For cases for which BAM auditors identify errors, the BAM  data also include information on the errors. In 2016, work search issues,  benefit year earnings, and separation issues were the most common  causes of reported overpayments:\nWork search issues. These occur when the state finds that claimants  did not actively search for work during the key week. Federal law  generally requires people receiving unemployment compensation to  be actively searching for work. States have discretion to establish  requirements for what constitutes active work search, and these  requirements vary by state.\nBenefit year earnings issues. These occur when claimants have  earnings that exceed the threshold for UI eligibility in their state or  when these earnings are not properly reported.\nSeparation issues. These occur when claimants are ultimately  determined to be ineligible for UI due to disqualifying job separations,  such as quitting a job without good cause or being discharged for  misconduct under the state UI law.\nOther causes of overpayments include incorrect reporting of wages used  to calculate benefits, able and available to work issues, employment  service registration issues, and other issues. For some cases, BAM  investigators identify multiple errors with different causes. When this  occurs, BAM investigators determine the overpayment amount associated  with each cause.\nBAM sample data is weighted to make inferences about the population. In  accordance with DOL\u2019s method, we calculated the weight on each BAM  sample case as (1) the number of unemployment compensation  payments to claimants for the state and the week from which the BAM  sample case was selected divided by, and (2) the number of completed  BAM sample cases for that week, as long as there were two or more  completed cases for the week.\nBecause each state followed a probability procedure based on random  selections to pick cases, the BAM sample is only one of a large number of  samples that they might have drawn. Since each sample could have  provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision  of the BAM sample\u2019s results using confidence intervals. For example, a  95 percent confidence interval is the interval that would contain the actual  population value for 95 percent of the samples that could have been  drawn. In some tables we provide the margin of error instead of the  confidence interval, where the margin of error is the half-width of the  confidence interval.\nOur analysis sample consists of cases with no missing or invalid values of  variables used in our analysis that also have positive sample weights. Our  analysis sample includes 98.1percent of all cases.\n\n\t\tEstimated Overpayment Rates Due to Failure to Meet Work Search Requirement\n\nIn accordance with DOL\u2019s method, the estimated overpayment rate is  equal to the amount of UI benefits overpaid as a percentage of the total  amount of UI benefits paid. The amount of UI benefits overpaid includes  fraud, nonfraud recoverable, and nonfraud nonrecoverable  overpayments; and overpayments from all causes and responsible  parties. The amount overpaid excludes overpayments that DOL considers  as technically proper. An overpayment may be considered technically  proper by DOL under a finality rule, which generally means that too much  time has passed between the decision to pay the claimant and the  detection of the eligibility issue, or for some other reason. Our estimated  work search overpayment rate is calculated using the same method as  the official overpayment rate and is generally comparable to work search  overpayment rates reported by DOL.\nMore specifically, we used the BAM data to identify cases with  overpayments and with overpayments due to work search, excluding  formal warnings and other payments DOL considers to be technically  proper. Next, we applied DOL\u2019s proration algorithm to allocate  overpayment amounts for each error associated with a case so that the  total amount of overpayments from all errors does not exceed the key  week amount paid. Then, we calculated the total overpayment amount  and work search overpayment amount for cases with overpayments and  work search overpayments, respectively. Finally, we tracked the key  week amount paid for each case. To estimate the work search  overpayment rate for each state and fiscal year, we calculated the  weighted sum of work search overpayment amounts as a percentage of  the weighted sum of amounts paid.\nTable 4 shows the estimated national work search overpayment rate, the  average estimated state work search overpayment rate, and the median  estimated state work search overpayment rate for each fiscal year. The  national work search overpayment rate estimate has increased from 2.4  percent in 2013 to 4.5 percent in 2017. Over the same time period, the  average state work search overpayment rate estimate has increased from  2.6 to 4.6 percent, and the median state work search overpayment rate  estimate has increased from 1.4 percent to 2.7 percent. Most states\u2019  work search overpayment rate estimates are less than 5 percent, but  some states\u2019 rates are more than 10 percent.\nTo identify state practices and other factors that may be associated with  state work search overpayment rates, we reviewed DOL documents  describing the BAM program and summarizing key features of states\u2019 UI  programs, as well as research on factors associated with time claimants  spend searching for employment. Based on our review, we identified  factors that may be associated with work search overpayments that can  be measured using variables in the BAM data:\nExemptions from work search requirements. According to DOL, while  federal law generally requires claimants to be actively seeking work, it  does allow states to exempt claimants in some circumstances. For  example, according to DOL, because states may not deny benefits to  an individual in approved training, all states provide an exemption  from the requirements to be able and available for work and  conducting an active work search for any week the individual is in  approved training. In addition, according to DOL, some states allow  work search exemptions if the worker is union-attached and finds  work through the union hall, or if a separation is classified as a  temporary lay-off and there is a reasonable expectation that the  worker will return to work soon. According to DOL, other state work  search exemptions include that the worker has a specified start date  for new employment, has jury duty, has a compelling personal reason,  is in a labor dispute with the employer, is the victim of domestic  violence, or labor market or other information indicates no suitable  employment.\nIt is possible for a case with a claimant who indicated he or she was  not required to search for work to have a work search error if the  claimant provided an invalid reason for being exempt from his or her  state\u2019s work search requirement. For example, the claimant may have  said that he or she was a member of a union with a hiring hall and  obtained employment through union referrals or that he or she had a  definite recall date, and therefore, the work search requirement was  waived. However, the BAM investigator\u2019s verification with the union  found that the claimant was not in good standing, or the investigator\u2019s  verification with the employer found that the claimant had no definite  recall date. In such a situation, the claimant might be held ineligible for  a failure to conduct an active work search because the exemption was  invalid.\nClaimant response. According to DOL, the claimant interview anchors  the BAM audit and is a major error detection point, and the claimant  questionnaire is a required standard form. Claimants may provide  information for the BAM audit either in person, over the phone, or via  mail or some other method. Some claimants may not respond to the  audit at all. For the period from 2013 to 2017, of the work search  overpayments that BAM auditors detected in their BAM sample of  cases, about 37 percent of cases were uncovered during the claimant  interview.\nState investigation of job contacts. Claimants are asked to provide  information about job contacts as evidence that they were actively  searching for work as part of the required claimant questionnaire. In  addition, even if the claimant does not respond to the BAM audit, job  contacts may be available for BAM auditors to investigate if the state\u2019s  continued claim process captured the claimant\u2019s work search  information. BAM staff must investigate a sufficient number of  contacts to establish whether the claimant has met the state\u2019s work  search requirement. For the period from 2013 to 2017, of the work  search overpayments that BAM auditors detected in the BAM sample  of cases, about 45 percent were uncovered by investigating claimant- provided job contacts.\nState use of formal warnings. If the BAM audit of a case determines  that the claimant\u2019s work search during the key week was not  acceptable, the state might issue a formal warning to the claimant  instead of finding that the claimant received a work search  overpayment, and these cases are not included in the calculation of  the work search overpayment rate for that state. Over the period from  2013 to 2017, of the BAM sample of cases for which work search  errors were identified, state workforce agencies issued formal  warnings for about 46 percent.\nClaimant demographic and other characteristics. Characteristics of  claimants that are associated with the amount of time claimants spend  searching for work include age, education, gender, length of time  between initial claim and key week, and weekly benefit amount as a  percentage of the normal weekly wage in the claimant\u2019s industry. To  the extent that they affect time spent searching for work, these  characteristics may also be associated with the likelihood of claimants  receiving a work search overpayment.\nSome factors that may be associated with work search overpayments  cannot be measured using variables in the BAM data and, thus, are  excluded from our analysis. Examples include:\nMinimum number of work search activities. According to DOL, the  minimum number of work search activities required per week varies  across states and can vary based on labor market conditions, which  can, for example, produce different requirements in a rural area  versus an urban area. However, some states do not specify a  required number of work search activities and instead require that the  number of work search activities be \u201creasonable,\u201d according to a DOL  report.\nType of required employer contacts. According to DOL, some states  allow claimants to search for part-time work as well as full-time work,  while others do not. In addition, according to DOL, some states  specify that participation in reemployment services counts as a  contact, and some states require claimants to make at least one  contact through the state online system.\nFrequency and method of reporting. According to DOL, some states  require weekly claimant reporting of work search activities, while  others require bi-weekly reporting. In addition, according to DOL,  some states require claimants to report online as part of their  continued claim, while others require claimants to keep a log of their  work search activities.\n\n\t\tEconometric Mode\n\nOur econometric model is the following:  work search overpayment rates, = \u03b1 + \u03b2\u2217work search requireds, +  \u03b3*n-person responses, + \u03b3*telephone responses, + \u03b3*mail, email,  fax, or other responses, + \u03b4*contacts investigateds, + \u03c6 + X\u2019\u0398 + year indicators + \u03b5,  where s and y denote state and year, respectively, and the explanatory  variables in the model are the following:\nWork search required is the estimated fraction of cases with claimants  for whom work search is required, according to the BAM data.\nIn-person response, telephone response, and mail, email, fax, or  other response are the estimated fractions of cases with claimants  who responded to the BAM audit in person, by telephone, or by mail,  email, fax, or other method, respectively.\nContacts investigated is the estimated fraction of cases for which  BAM auditors investigated one or more job contacts.\nLow, moderate, and frequent formal warning use are binary indicator  variables equal to 1 if the state issued a low, moderate, or high  number of formal warnings in the fiscal year as a percentage of BAM  cases with work search errors, respectively, and 0 otherwise. We  defined low formal warning states as those that issued formal  warnings for some but less than 25 percent of the cases with work  search errors, moderate formal warning states as those that issued  formal warnings for at least 25 percent but less than 75 percent of  cases with work search errors, and high formal warning states as  those that issued formal warnings for anywhere from 75 to 100  percent of cases with work search errors. The omitted group is states  that issued no formal warnings during the fiscal year.\nX is a list of other characteristics of claimants that may be associated  with work search, including the estimated distributions of cases across  claimants\u2019 age groups, education levels, gender, length of time  between initial claim and key week, and weekly benefit amount as a  percentage of the normal weekly wage for their occupation.  \u03b5 is an error term.\nThe parameters of interest in our econometric model are \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b3, \u03b3, \u03b4,  \u03c6 is an estimate of the change in the work search  overpayment rate associated with a 1 percentage point increase in the  fraction of cases with claimants who responded to the BAM audit in  person, all else being equal. The parameters \u03b3 and \u03b3 are estimates  of the change in the work search overpayment rate associated with a  1 percentage point increase in the fraction of cases with claimants  who responded to the BAM audit by telephone and by mail, email, fax,  or other method, respectively, all else being equal.\nThe parameter \u03b4 is an estimate of the change in the work search  overpayment rate associated with a 1 percentage point increase in the  fraction of cases for which BAM auditors investigated one or more job  contacts, all else being equal.\nThe parameters \u03c6Table 5 shows descriptive statistics for the explanatory variables, other  than formal warnings.\nTable 6 shows descriptive statistics for states\u2019 use of formal warnings.\nOur analysis is subject to several limitations, and the results we discuss  below should be interpreted with caution.\nNo causality. Our econometric approach can establish correlations  between state work search overpayment rate estimates and the  factors we analyzed, but it cannot establish causal relationships. This  limitation is especially important when it comes to interpreting the  relationship between work search overpayment rate estimates and the  fraction of cases for which BAM auditors investigated job contacts.  BAM investigations can only detect work search overpayments, not  prevent them, because BAM investigators are reviewing cases after  the payment has already been made. Preventing work search  overpayments is the only way to reduce the work search overpayment  rates. Thus, the relationship between investigation of claimant- provided contacts and work search overpayment rates likely reflects  not a causal relationship but an equilibrium relationship in which  claimants who know that their job contacts will be investigated are  more likely to search for work, all else being equal.\nNongeneralizability. Our results do not generalize to other time  periods with different labor market conditions, different rules and  regulations about unemployment insurance, or other differences.\nOmitted variables. As discussed above, we have excluded from our  models some state practices that may be associated with work search  overpayments because those variables were not included in the BAM  data. For example, we do not account for the fact that, according to  DOL, some states require claimants to engage in more work search  activities than other states, which could affect the likelihood that a  claimant receives a work search overpayment. In addition, according  to DOL, some states require claimants to report their work search  activities in order to continue receiving benefits, which might prevent  some work search overpayments from occurring. We have also likely  excluded some relevant claimant characteristics as well. For example,  total income for a claimant\u2019s household and a claimant\u2019s number of  dependents may affect their work search efforts. However, variables  describing a claimant\u2019s household income and composition are not  included in the BAM data and thus are omitted from our analysis. To  the extent that these factors are correlated with the factors we  included, our estimates of the relationships between work search  overpayment rates and the included factors could be biased.\nMeasurement error. Our variables may have been measured with  error, which could bias our coefficient estimates. If the measurement  error is random, our coefficient estimates would be biased down, but if  the measurement error is systematic, then we cannot say whether our  coefficient estimates would be biased down or up.\n\n\tResults\n\nOur baseline specification suggests that some state practices are  associated with state work search overpayment rates estimates (see  column 1 of table 7). We used the 10 percent level of significance as our  threshold for statistical significance because we have a relatively small  number of observations (259).\nState work search overpayment rate estimates were higher in states  with more cases with claimants who were required to search for work.  A 1 percentage point increase in the fraction of cases with claimants  required to search for work was associated with a 0.084 percentage  point increase in the work search overpayment rate estimates on  average, all else being equal.\nWork search overpayment rate estimates were lower in states with  more cases for which the BAM auditors investigated one or more job  contacts. A one percentage point increase in the fraction of cases for  which the BAM auditors investigated contacts was associated with a  0.072 percentage point reduction in the work search overpayment rate  on average, all else being equal.\nCompared to states that did not issue any formal warnings, work  search overpayment rate estimates were higher in states that made  low or moderate use of formal warnings but lower in states that issued  formal warnings frequently. Work search overpayment rate estimates  in states that were low and moderate users of formal warnings were  3.9 and 3.1 percentage points higher on average than those in states  that issued no formal warnings, all else being equal. Work search  overpayment rate estimates in states that were frequent users of  formal warnings were 3.5 percentage points lower on average than  those in states that issued no formal warnings.\nOur state-level analysis also suggests that some characteristics of cases  are not associated with state work search overpayment rate estimates,  but others are. State work search overpayment rate estimates were not  significantly associated with the distribution of cases by claimant age,  gender, duration of unemployment benefits receipt, or key week amount  as a percentage of the normal weekly wage in their occupation, or with  the number of cases. However, state work search overpayment rate  estimates were higher in states with more cases with claimants with some  college or an associate\u2019s degree relative to cases with claimants without a  high school degree or GED. A one percentage point increase in the  estimated fraction of cases with claimants with some college or an  associates degree was associated with a 0.192 percentage point increase  in estimated work search overpayment rates on average, all else being  equal.\nTo assess the sensitivity of our results, we estimated fractional response  models with robust standard errors instead of clustered standard errors  (see column (2) of table 7). We also estimated fractional response models  that replaced the fractions of cases by claimant response method with the  fraction of cases with claimants who responded to the BAM audit by all  methods combined, with both types of standard errors. Finally, we  estimated linear models, also with both types of standard errors. While  the direction and magnitude of the relationship between estimated work  search overpayment rates and the fraction of cases with claimants  required to search for work was generally similar across specifications, it  was not always statistically significant. The direction, magnitude, and  statistical significance of the relationship between estimated work search  overpayment rates and the fraction of cases for which BAM auditors  investigated job contacts was generally similar across specifications, with  the exception of the linear model with clustered standard errors, where it  was not statistically significant. The directions, magnitudes, and statistical  significance of the relationship between estimated work search  overpayment rates and estimated state formal warning use were  generally similar across specifications.\n\nAppendix II: Additional Benefit Accuracy Measurement Data Tables\n\nThis appendix contains several tables that show the underlying data used  throughout this report, using the Department of Labor\u2019s Benefit Accuracy  Measurement (BAM) data for fiscal years 2013 through 2017.\nAccording to DOL, because the BAM data are based on a statistical  survey, estimates produced from our analysis of the BAM data are  subject to sampling and non-sampling errors. Sampling errors are errors  that arise in a data collection process as a result of taking a sample from  a population rather than using the whole population. Non-sampling errors  are errors or biases that arise in a data collection process as a result of  factors other than taking a sample, such as the timeliness of data  collection, data entry errors, biased questions in fact-finding, biased  decision-making, and inappropriate analysis and conclusions completed  by state investigators or false or inaccurate information provided by  survey respondents. We express our confidence in the precision of our  results by reporting the margins of error associated with 95 percent  confidence intervals. This is the interval that would contain the actual  population value for 95 percent of the samples the respective agency  could have drawn.\nIn addition, it may be misleading to compare one state's work search  overpayment rates with another state's rates. According to DOL, no two  states' written laws, regulations, and policies specifying eligibility  conditions are identical, and differences in these conditions influence the  potential for error.\nThe following tables and information are included in this appendix:\nTable 8: The estimated overpayment amounts for the Unemployment  Insurance (UI) program by cause in fiscal year 2017 (also represented  in fig. 2 in the letter portion).\nTable 9: The national work search overpayment rate estimates and  dollar amounts for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 (also represented in  fig. 3 in the letter portion).\nTable 10: The work search overpayment rates estimates and dollar  amount of work search overpayments in each state in fiscal year  2017, excluding cases where formal warnings were given.\nTable 11: The percentage of cases in which claimants were required  to search for work and the percentage of those cases in which job  contacts were investigated in each state in fiscal year 2017.\nTable 12: For states that issued formal warnings in 2017, the UI  overpayment rate estimates excluding and including cases in which  formal warnings were issued, and the difference in the dollar amount  of overpayments if formal warnings were not used.\n\nAppendix III: Summary of Six States\u2019 Work Search Requirements for Unemployment Insurance Claimants\n\nWork search requirements for Unemployment Insurance claimants vary  by state. According to our review of program documents in our six  selected states, the minimum number of work search activities required  per week ranged from not specified to four. Three of the states limited the  work search activities to applying for jobs or contacting employers in other  ways and the three other states had broader definitions of what would  qualify as a work search activity. See table 13 below for a summary of the  work search requirements, confirmed by state officials, for the six states  included in our review.\n\nAppendix IV: Comments from the Department of Labor\n\nAppendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\n\n\tGAO Contact\n\nCindy Brown Barnes 202-512-7215 or brownbarnesc@gao.gov.\n\n\tStaff Acknowledgments\n\nIn addition to the contact names above, Danielle Giese (Assistant  Director), Cathy Roark (Analyst in Charge), Carl Barden, Rachel Beers,  Deborah Bland, Beryl Davis, Holly Dye, Alex Galuten, Dana Hopings, Joel  Marus, Phillip McIntyre, Sheila R.

    "output": "Why GAO Did This Study\n\nThe UI program, which is overseen by DOL and administered by states, paid $30 billion to about 5.7 million individuals in 2017. Under federal law, to be eligible for benefits, individuals are generally required to actively search for work, but the specific work search requirements vary by state. Yet, states found that some benefits were overpaid to UI claimants who were ineligible because they were not meeting work search requirements. GAO was asked to review improper payments due to UI claimants' failure to actively search for work. Building on GAO's prior work ( GAO-18-133R ), this report examines (1) state administrative practices associated with work search overpayments; (2) selected states' approaches to address work search overpayments; and (3) DOL's oversight and support of states' efforts.\nGAO analyzed DOL data, including the results of state reviews of a representative random sample of UI payments made from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. GAO also reviewed UI information from six states selected for variation in work search requirements and overpayment rates, interviewed DOL and state officials, and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nGAO's analysis of Department of Labor (DOL) data found that certain state administrative practices, such as reviewing a higher percentage of claimant-reported work search activities and frequent use of formal warnings, were associated with lower estimated work search overpayment rates for the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program. According to DOL data, 22 states were warning claimants after the first discovered occurrence of their failure to meet work search requirements (i.e., issuing formal warnings) rather than reporting that an overpayment was made, while the other states were reporting such cases as overpayments. In 2017, DOL determined that federal law does not permit states to use such policies. GAO's analysis of DOL data shows that in fiscal year 2017, estimated work search overpayments were nearly $1.4 billion (see fig.), but would have been an estimated $1.8 billion (+/-$0.2 billion) greater if states had not issued formal warnings and established overpayments. DOL officials told GAO in July 2017 that the agency would issue a letter to states informing them that federal law does not permit them to warn claimants instead of establishing an overpayment. To date, DOL has not issued the letter. Until DOL provides states with such notification, states may continue to report inconsistent information on overpayments.\nState officials GAO interviewed reported using multiple approaches to address work search overpayments, including using their online systems that automate collecting information on claimants' work search activities; conducting audits of claimants work search activities beyond those required; and sending automated messages to claimants regarding their work search requirements. Officials said that their approaches encouraged claimants to conduct a more active work search and prevented work search overpayments in some cases.\nDOL monitors states' work search overpayment rate estimates and has helped states address such overpayments, but lacks clear procedures for how states should verify claimants' work search activities. DOL directs states to verify a \u201csufficient\u201d number of work search activities during their audits but has not provided information on what is considered sufficient. DOL data show that some states did not review claimants' work search activities for a majority of audited cases. DOL officials said that the agency plans to clarify its procedures after issuing a letter about formal warnings. By clarifying these procedures, DOL will have greater assurance that states are complying with verification requirements.\n\nWhat GAO Recommends\n\nGAO is making four recommendations to DOL, including that it provide states information about its determination that the use of state formal warning policies is no longer permissible and clarify its work search verification requirements. DOL agreed with GAO's recommendations and stated that it would take action to address them.",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBackground\n\nState is the lead agency involved in implementing American foreign policy  and representing the United States abroad. According to State and  USAID\u2019s joint strategic plan for fiscal years 2018 through 2022, State\u2019s  goals are to (1) protect America\u2019s security at home and abroad, (2) renew  America\u2019s competitive advantage for sustained economic growth and job  creation, (3) promote American leadership through balanced  engagement, and (4) ensure effectiveness and accountability to the  American taxpayer.\nState\u2019s Foreign Service employees serve in a variety of functions at  overseas posts as either generalists or specialists. Foreign Service  generalists help formulate and implement U.S. foreign policy and are  assigned to work in one of five career tracks: consular, economic,  management, political, or public diplomacy. Generalists at overseas posts  collect information and engage with foreign governments and citizens of  foreign countries and report the results of these interactions back to State  headquarters in Washington, D.C., among other functions. Foreign  Service specialists abroad support and maintain the functioning of  overseas posts and serve in one of 25 different skill groups, in positions  such as security officer or information management. Specialists at  overseas posts play a critical role in ensuring the security and  maintenance of the posts\u2019 facilities, computer networks, and supplies as  well as the protection of post staff, their family members, and local staff,  among other functions.\nState may require Foreign Service employees to be available for service  anywhere in the world, as needed, and State has the authority to direct  Foreign Service employees to any of its posts overseas or to its  headquarters in Washington, D.C. However, as noted in our 2012  report, State generally does not use this authority, preferring other means  of filling high-priority positions, according to State officials. The process  of assigning Foreign Service employees to their positions typically begins  when they receive a list of upcoming vacancies for which they may  compete. Foreign Service employees then submit a list of positions for  which they would like to be considered, known as bids, to the Office of  Career Development and Assignments and consult with their career  development officer. The process varies depending on an officer\u2019s grade  and functional specialty, and State uses a variety of incentives to  encourage Foreign Service employees to bid on difficult-to-fill posts.\nState groups countries of the world\u2014and corresponding U.S. overseas  posts in these countries\u2014into areas of responsibility under six geographic  regional bureaus:\nBureau of African Affairs\nBureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs\nBureau of European and Eurasian Affairs\nBureau of Near Eastern Affairs\nBureau of South and Central Asian Affairs\nBureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs  Overseas posts report to State headquarters through their respective  regional bureaus. For example, because the Bureau of African Affairs has  responsibility for developing and managing U.S. policy concerning parts  of the African continent, U.S. overseas posts in Nigeria report through the  bureau to State headquarters.\nAccording to State officials, State maintains personnel data on State  employees in its GEMS database. GEMS includes information on Foreign  Service and Civil Service positions; in particular, it shows the total number  of authorized Foreign Service positions at State and whether each  position is currently filled or vacant. As displayed in figure 1, the GEMS  data show that the majority of Foreign Service employees (73 percent)  work in positions at overseas posts. However, some Foreign Service staff  (27 percent) are assigned to positions in the United States, where they  may complete required language or other training, serve as desk officers  for the regional bureaus, or work in other functions at State headquarters.\n\n\t\tOverseas Foreign Service Vacancies Have Persisted over Time While Overseas Foreign Service Staffing Has Increased, Staffing Gaps Persist\n\nAccording to State data, the number of both staffed and vacant overseas  Foreign Service positions increased between 2008 and 2018. As shown  in figure 2, the number of positions staffed grew from 6,979 in 2008 to  8,574 in 2018\u2014a more than 20 percent increase. Despite the increase in  the number of positions staffed, our analysis found that as of March 31,  2018, overall, 13 percent of State\u2019s overseas Foreign Service positions  were vacant. This vacancy percentage is similar to the percentages of  vacancies in overseas Foreign Service positions that we reported in 2012  and 2008. In 2012, we reported that 14 percent of State\u2019s overseas  Foreign Service positions were vacant as of October 31, 2011, and we  reported that the same percentage of overseas Foreign Service  positions\u201414 percent\u2014were vacant as of September 30, 2008.\nAccording to State officials, State\u2019s ability to hire Foreign Service  employees to fill persistent vacancies has been affected by factors such  as reduced appropriations. For instance, according to State officials and  State\u2019s Five Year Workforce Plan, because of funding cuts enacted in  fiscal year 2013, State could only hire one employee for every two leaving  the Foreign Service. From fiscal years 2014 to 2016, funding for State\u2019s  annual appropriations supported hiring to replace Foreign Service  employees projected to leave the agency, according to State officials.  These officials indicated, however, that Foreign Service hiring was again  impacted from January 2017 through May 2018 by a hiring freeze. As a  result, State hired below levels required to replace full projected attrition  of Foreign Service employees.\n\n\t\tState\u2019s Data Show Higher Vacancy Rates in Foreign Service Specialist Positions Compared to Foreign Service Generalist Positions\n\nWhile State\u2019s data show persistent vacancies in both generalist and  specialist positions at overseas posts, specialist positions remain vacant  at a higher rate. State\u2019s data show that 12 percent (680 of 5,660) of  overseas Foreign Service generalist positions were vacant as of March  31, 2018, a slight decrease from the 14 percent of overseas Foreign  Service generalist positions that we reported vacant in 2012. State\u2019s  data also show that 14.2 percent (594 of 4,188) of all overseas Foreign  Service specialist positions were vacant, close to the 14.8 percent  vacancy rate that we reported in 2012.\n\n\t\t\tForeign Service Generalists\n\nState\u2019s data show persistent vacancies in Foreign Service generalist  positions responsible for analysis, engagement, and reporting at overseas  posts. As shown in table 1, among Foreign Service generalist career  tracks, the political, economic, and \u201cother\u201d tracks had the largest  percentage of vacant positions, with, respectively, 20 percent, 16 percent,  and 14 percent of positions vacant as of March 31, 2018. Our 2012 report  noted vacancies in the same three career tracks. Political officers at  overseas posts are responsible for collecting and analyzing information  on political events, engaging with foreign governments, and reporting  back to State headquarters. Economic officers at overseas posts work  with foreign governments and other U.S. agencies on technology,  science, economic, trade, and environmental issues. The \u201cother\u201d  generalist career track includes positions designated as \u201cExecutive\u201d or  \u201cInternational Relations,\u201d which, according to State officials, may be filled  by generalists from any of State\u2019s five career tracks.\nState\u2019s data show persistent vacancies in Foreign Service specialist  positions that support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts.  Among the 10 largest Foreign Service specialist skill groups, security  officer, office management specialist, and information management had  the largest percentages of vacant positions. As shown in figure 3, in these  three groups, respectively, 16 percent, 16 percent, and 14 percent of  positions were vacant. The vacancies in these three specialist skill groups  are persistent; in 2012, we reported that the same three groups had the  largest numbers of vacant positions. Security officers are typically  responsible for responding to various threats to the physical security of  overseas posts and for ensuring the protection of post staff, their family  members, and local staff. Office management specialists provide  professional management and administrative support. Information  management staff are typically responsible for maintaining and ensuring  the security of State\u2019s computer networks and communications systems  at overseas posts.\n\n\t\tState Faces Challenges Recruiting Personnel to Fill Some Foreign Service Specialist Positions That Often Require Specialized Skills and Competencies\n\nState officials said that State has had difficulty in recruiting and hiring  Foreign Service employees to fill specialist positions in some skill groups  at overseas posts. According to State officials and staff at overseas posts,  some vacant specialist positions are more difficult to fill than others  because candidates for these positions must often possess skills in fields  such as medicine or information technology that tend to be highly sought  after in the private sector. According to staff at overseas posts, it is not  uncommon for specialist candidates in these fields to choose higher- paying jobs in the private sector rather than specialist positions in the  Foreign Service. Additionally, in some circumstances, State must  compete with other federal agencies to recruit specialists from the same  limited pool of talent. Consequently, according to State officials, State has  been unable to attract and retain personnel with the skills necessary to fill  some Foreign Service specialist positions, which has led to persistent  vacancies in specialist positions.\nVacancies in Foreign Service specialist positions at overseas posts  present additional challenges because specialized skills and  competencies are often required to perform the work of these positions.  According to State officials, because Foreign Service generalists may be  assigned to work outside of their career tracks, in some circumstances,  State has more flexibility in filling a generalist vacancy than a specialist  vacancy. For example, generalists outside the consular career track can  serve as a consular officer for one or more tours of duty. However,  specialist positions often require specialized skills or experience that  generalists may not possess. In addition, according to staff at overseas  posts, it is generally not possible for a Foreign Service specialist from one  skill group to perform the work of a Foreign Service specialist from a  different skill group. For instance, a Foreign Service specialist assigned  to the medical section at a post will not be able to help address the  workload of a vacant position in the information management section.  Thus, according to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in specialist  positions at the posts may create greater challenges than vacancies in  generalist positions.\n\n\t\tState\u2019s Data Show Persistent Foreign Service Vacancies at Overseas Posts with State\u2019s Highest Foreign Policy Priorities\n\nAccording to State\u2019s data, as of March 31, 2018, overseas posts with  State\u2019s highest foreign policy priorities had the highest percentages of  vacant Foreign Service positions. Using its Overseas Staffing Model  process, State assigns each embassy to one of seven categories based  primarily on the level and type of work required to pursue the U.S.  government\u2019s diplomatic relations with the host country at post. As we  previously reported, the rankings are closely associated with the  department\u2019s foreign policy priorities; the higher the category, the greater  the resources needed to conduct the work of the overseas post and the  higher the post\u2019s foreign policy priority. For example, the highest-level  category, level 5+, includes the largest, most comprehensive full-service  posts, where the host country\u2019s regional and global role requires  extensive U.S. personnel resources. The lowest-level category includes  small embassies with limited requirements for advocacy, liaison, and  coordination in the host country\u2019s government. As shown in table 2,  according to State\u2019s data, as of March 31, 2018, overseas posts in the  \u201cEmbassy 5+\u201d category had the highest percentage of vacant positions.  The results of this analysis were similar to those we reported in 2012.\n\n\t\tState\u2019s Data Show Higher Vacancy Rates in Regions with Security Risks That Could Threaten U.S. Foreign Policy Interests\n\nWhile State has Foreign Service vacancies worldwide, as of March 31,  2018, the highest percentages of vacancies were in the South and  Central Asian Affairs Bureau (SCA) and Near Eastern Affairs Bureau  (NEA)\u2014bureaus representing regions with heightened security risks that  could threaten U.S. foreign policy interests, according to State. SCA,  which includes countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, faces  a host of security and stability challenges that could threaten U.S.  interests, according to a February 2018 report from State\u2019s Office of  Inspector General. NEA includes countries, such as Egypt, Iraq, and  Saudi Arabia, which have faced numerous security threats in recent years  that could also threaten U.S. interests overseas.\nAs shown in figure 4, among State\u2019s regional bureaus, as of March 31,  2018, SCA and NEA had the highest percentages of overseas Foreign  Service vacancies at 21 percent (238 of 1,115 positions) and 18 percent  (234 of 1,279 positions), respectively. In 2012, we reported that these  two bureaus also had the highest percentages of overseas Foreign  Service vacancies among regional bureaus.\n\n\t\tOverseas Foreign Service Vacancies Have Adverse Effects on State\u2019s Diplomatic Readiness Vacancies in Overseas Foreign Service Positions Increase Workloads and Affect Employee Morale, According to Staff at Overseas Posts\n\nVacancies in Foreign Service positions at overseas posts increase  workloads and adversely affect the morale of Foreign Service employees.  According to State officials in headquarters and staff at overseas posts,  when a Foreign Service position at an overseas post is vacant, Foreign  Service employees at that post are generally responsible for covering the  workload of the vacant position. Further, Foreign Service employees at  some posts\u2014particularly posts with fewer Foreign Service staff\u2014may be  responsible for covering the workload of multiple vacant positions. For  example, at two African posts we heard examples of Foreign Service  employees covering the workload of multiple vacant Foreign Service  positions. As a result of increased workloads, Foreign Service employees  are also more likely to have less time available to perform some important  functions, according to staff at overseas posts. According to staff at  overseas posts, such functions include training and supervising entry- level Foreign Service employees, local staff, and eligible family members  (EFM); reducing the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse; improving and  innovating processes at post that could reduce inefficiencies; initiating  and implementing projects that could enhance various diplomatic efforts;  and conducting maintenance of systems.\nIn addition, according to staff at overseas posts, vacancies adversely  affect staff morale. Staff at multiple posts said that vacancies and the  resulting increased workloads had created substantial stress and  increased \u201cburnout\u201d of Foreign Service employees at the posts. They  noted that these levels of stress and burnout had contributed to Foreign  Service employees\u2019 ending their overseas assignments early for medical  or personal reasons. These curtailments, in turn, had increased the  overall vacancies and their effects at overseas posts.\n\n\t\tVacancies in Overseas Foreign Service Generalist Positions, Especially in the Political and Economic Career Tracks, Adversely Affect State\u2019s Diplomatic Readiness\n\nAccording to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in Foreign Service  generalist positions at overseas posts adversely affect State\u2019s diplomatic  readiness. Among Foreign Service generalist career tracks, the political  and economic career tracks had the two largest percentages of vacant  positions\u201420 percent and 16 percent, respectively\u2014as of March 31,  2018.\nAccording to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in political and economic  positions at overseas posts\u2014particularly posts with fewer Foreign Service  employees\u2014limit the amount of reporting on political and economic  developments that posts are able to submit back to State headquarters.  For example, Foreign Service employees from three posts in Africa told  us that persistent, long-term vacancies in those posts\u2019 political and  economic positions had constrained their abilities to provide full reporting  on political and economic developments in their host countries. According  to staff at overseas posts, reporting on political and economic  developments in other countries\u2014submitted by overseas posts back to  State headquarters\u2014is essential for State to make informed foreign policy  decisions. Foreign Service employees from two posts in large countries in  East and South Asia also told us that vacancies in these sections had  limited their capacity to engage with host government officials on  important, strategic issues for the United States, such as reducing nuclear  proliferation or enhancing trade and investment relationships with the  United States. Vacancies in the political and economic career tracks at  overseas posts could adversely affect State\u2019s ability to achieve two of the  goals in State and USAID\u2019s joint strategic plan for fiscal years 2018  through 2022\u2014(1) renew America\u2019s competitive advantage for sustained  economic growth and job creation and (2) promote American leadership  through balanced engagement.\n\n\t\tVacancies in Overseas Foreign Service Specialist Positions May Heighten Security Risks at Overseas Posts and Disrupt Post Operations\n\nAccording to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in Foreign Service  specialist positions at overseas posts may heighten the level of security  risk at the posts and disrupt post operations. Among Foreign Service  specialist skill groups with the highest number of vacant positions,  security officer, office management specialist, and information  management had the largest percentages of vacant positions\u201416  percent, 16 percent, and 14 percent, respectively\u2014as of March 31, 2018.\n\n\t\t\tSecurity Officer\n\nAccording to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in security officer  positions at overseas posts reduce the amount of time that security staff  can spend identifying, investigating, and responding to potential security  threats to the post. Security officers are also responsible for identifying  and analyzing host-country intelligence-gathering efforts at their  respective overseas posts\u2014and post staff told us that, because of  vacancies in these positions, some security officers had been unable to  complete this work for their posts, potentially increasing the risk of foreign  government officials gaining access to sensitive information. Also, post  staff told us that security officer vacancies limit the amount of time that  security officers present at posts can devote to important security  oversight activities, including regular training, drilling, and supervising of  local guard forces and security contractors. Post staff noted, for example,  that security officers at overseas posts should conduct regular training  and drilling exercises to evaluate their local guard force\u2019s effectiveness in  searching a vehicle entering the post compound for explosive devices.  According to post staff, when these important security oversight activities  are not properly and regularly conducted, the level of security risk at  these overseas posts may increase.\n\n\t\t\tInformation Management\n\nAccording to State officials in headquarters and staff at overseas posts,  as well as reporting by State\u2019s OIG, vacancies in information  management positions at overseas posts have increased the vulnerability  of posts\u2019 computer networks to potential cybersecurity attacks and other  malicious threats. State officials told us that the Foreign Service had  faced chronic shortages of information management staff available to fill  these positions worldwide. According to State officials, because of  ongoing information management vacancies, some required tasks\u2014such  as conducting planned network maintenance\u2014were performed  infrequently or not at all. In another example, staff at overseas posts said  that because of vacancies, information management staff had been  unable to regularly check their computer system logs to ensure that  security breaches had not taken place. Post staff added that, if a breach  did occur, vacancies could increase the amount of time needed to identify  an attack and deploy countermeasures, further increasing the risks to  posts\u2019 computer networks. Inspections conducted by State\u2019s OIG from fall  2014 to spring 2016 found that information management staff at 33  percent of overseas posts had not performed various required information  management duties. According to State\u2019s OIG, neglect of these duties  may leave the department vulnerable to increased cybersecurity attacks.\n\n\t\t\tOffice Management Specialist\n\nAccording to staff at overseas posts, the office management specialist  position at overseas posts has evolved considerably over time; these  specialists increasingly play a critical role in ensuring that the work of  overseas posts is effectively completed. Post staff said that office  management specialists provide administrative and other support  services to other Foreign Service employees and are assigned to various  sections of post. For example, staff at one post noted that office  management specialists assigned to the Security Officer sections at  overseas posts reduce the workload of security officers by completing  more routine security tasks and allowing the security officers to focus on  more challenging or involved tasks necessary to secure overseas posts.  Post staff told us that vacancies in office management specialist positions  reduce the amount of work that can be completed by other Foreign  Service employees at overseas posts. For example, when office  management specialist positions assigned to the Security Officer or  Information Management sections of posts are vacant, these vacancies  further exacerbate the higher number of vacancies that already exist in  these sections. According to staff at overseas posts, higher numbers of  office management specialist vacancies require other Foreign Service  employees to spend a significant amount of time on administrative tasks,  reducing the amount of time these staff can spend on mission-critical  activities.\n\n\tState Described Various Efforts to Address Overseas Foreign Service Vacancies, but These Efforts Are Not Guided by an Integrated Action Plan to Reduce Persistent Vacancies State Officials Described Various Efforts to Help Address Vacancies\n\nOfficials in headquarters and at overseas posts described various State  efforts to help address overseas Foreign Service vacancies. According to  State officials, Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts are a  complex problem that multiple offices within State address on an  individual basis.\n\n\t\tState\u2019s Efforts to Address Overseas Foreign Service Vacancies Are Not Guided by an Integrated Action Plan to Reduce Persistent Vacancies\n\nState\u2019s various efforts to address overseas Foreign Service vacancies are  not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies.  Our 2017 High-Risk Series report calls for agencies to, among other  things, design and implement action plan strategies for closing skills  gaps. The action plan should (1) define the root cause of all skills gaps  within an agency and (2) provide suggested corrective measures,  including steps necessary to implement solutions. This report also  emphasizes the high risk that mission-critical skills gaps in the federal  workforce pose to the nation.\nWhile various State offices have implemented the efforts we identified,  State lacks an action plan that is integrated\u2014or consolidated\u2014across its  relevant offices to guide its efforts to address persistent overseas Foreign  Service vacancies. Moreover, some staff at overseas posts  acknowledged that the efforts State has taken to help address vacancies  have not reduced persistent Foreign Service vacancies, notably in  specialist positions. In response to our inquiry about an action plan, State  officials said that the agency does not have a single document that  addresses Foreign Service staffing gaps at overseas posts. Instead, State  officials directed us to State\u2019s Five Year Workforce Plan: Fiscal Years  2016-2020, stating that it was the most comprehensive document that  outlines State\u2019s efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies at overseas  posts. The workforce plan notes that it provides a framework to address  State\u2019s human capital requirements and highlights State\u2019s challenges and  achievements in recruiting, hiring, staffing, and training Foreign Service  staff. However, in reviewing the portions of the workforce plan that State  indicated were most relevant, we found that the workforce plan does not  include an integrated action plan that defines the root causes of the  persistent overseas Foreign Service vacancies we identified or suggest  corrective measures to reduce vacancies in these positions, including  steps necessary to implement solutions.\nState officials also noted that they frequently meet to discuss and address  workforce issues. For example, they said they convene a multi-bureau  planning group that meets biweekly to discuss strategic workforce issues  such as hiring needs based on attrition and other issues. However,  according to State officials, this group has not developed an action plan to  reduce persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts.\nState lacks an integrated action plan to guide its efforts to address  persistent Foreign Service vacancies that includes corrective measures to  address the root causes of the vacancies. Without defining the root  causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts and  identifying appropriate corrective measures, overseas vacancies may  persist and continue to adversely affect State\u2019s ability to achieve U.S.  foreign policy goals.\n\n\tConclusions\n\nForeign Service generalists and specialists at overseas posts are critical  to advancing U.S. foreign policy and economic interests abroad.  However, for at least a decade, the Foreign Service has had persistent  vacancies in both generalist and specialist positions at overseas posts. In  particular, large numbers of vacant positions have persisted over time in  certain overseas Foreign Service positions, such as information  management and security officer positions. These vacancies in critical  positions at overseas posts have adversely affected State\u2019s ability to carry  out its mission effectively and threaten State\u2019s ability to ensure the  security and safety of its employees, their families, and post facilities.  While State has made some efforts to address Foreign Service  vacancies, addressing chronic vacancies in critical positions at overseas  posts requires a thoughtful, coherent, and integrated action plan that  defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at  overseas posts along with suggested corrective measures to reduce such  vacancies, following what was called for in our 2017 High-Risk Series  report. Developing such an action plan would help State address its  persistent staffing gaps, improve its ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy  goals, and help ensure secure and efficient operations.\n\n\tRecommendation for Executive Action\n\nThe Secretary of State should develop an integrated action plan that  defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at  overseas posts and provides suggested corrective measures to reduce  such vacancies, including steps necessary to implement solutions.  (Recommendation 1)\n\n\tAgency Comments\n\nWe provided a draft of this report to State for review and comment. In its  comments, reproduced in appendix III, State concurred with our  recommendation. State also noted that it has taken actions and identified  some causes of vacancies, but acknowledged that it lacks an integrated  action plan and will take steps to develop such a plan. State also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of State, and other interested parties. In  addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at  http://www.gao.gov.\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-6881 or bairj@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of  Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page  of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are  listed in appendix IV.\n\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\n\nThis report examines (1) vacancies in the Department of State\u2019s (State)  Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign  Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State\u2019s efforts to  address Foreign Service vacancies.\nTo address these three objectives, we interviewed State officials from the  department\u2019s Bureau of Human Resources and Bureau of Consular  Affairs as well as State officials representing the Offices of the Executive  Director for State\u2019s six regional bureaus. We also interviewed staff at 10  overseas posts. We conducted in-person interviews with staff at 3 of  these posts\u2014the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the U.S. Consulate in  Shanghai, China, and the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India. We  conducted telephone interviews with staff at the other 7 posts\u2014the U.S.  Embassies in Abuja, Nigeria; Bogota, Colombia; Kinshasa, Democratic  Republic of the Congo; Kabul, Afghanistan; Mexico City, Mexico; and  N\u2019Djamena, Chad; and the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany. We  used the following criteria to select overseas posts for interviews: (1)  posts with larger numbers of Foreign Service vacancies; (2) posts with  diversity in the types of Foreign Service positions that were vacant; (3)  posts with higher relative importance to U.S. economic, national security,  and other foreign policy interests; and (4) posts in a range of geographic  locations by State region.\nTo examine vacancies in State\u2019s Foreign Service staffing at overseas  posts, we analyzed State\u2019s personnel data on Foreign Service staffing at  overseas posts from the department\u2019s Global Employment Management  System (GEMS), as of March 2018. Our analysis of the GEMS data  includes Foreign Service positions filled by permanent Foreign Service  employees as well as positions filled by nonpermanent Foreign Service  employees, such as Consular Fellows. This analysis does not include the  number of staffed and vacant positions at overseas posts in Libya, Syria,  and Yemen, which, at the time of our review, were in suspended  operations status, as well as U.S. Mission Somalia, which was operating  under special circumstances at a different location.\nTo calculate vacancy rates, we divided the total number of positions by  the number of positions listed as vacant in GEMS. For example, a post  with 10 positions and 2 vacancies would have a vacancy rate of 20  percent. We calculated vacancy rates for each of the following categories:  type (i.e., generalist or specialist), function (e.g., consular or information  management), regional bureau (i.e., Bureau of African Affairs or Bureau  of Western Hemisphere Affairs), and embassy and nonembassy rankings  from State\u2019s Overseas Staffing Model (i.e., Embassy 3+ or 5).\nAccording to State officials, the data in GEMS have a number of  limitations:\nThe number of vacant positions at overseas posts listed in GEMS  may be overstated, because State has not yet decided to remove  some of these positions from its database.\nSome of the vacancies in GEMS are short-term or temporary. Foreign  Service employees periodically rotate out of their positions at their  overseas posts, sometimes creating temporary vacancies until the  positions are filled by incoming Foreign Service employees.\nThe GEMS data show larger numbers of vacant Foreign Service  positions at posts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan than actually  were unstaffed at these posts. According to State officials, this  discrepancy results from State\u2019s relying heavily on shorter-term  assignments to fill Foreign Service positions at these locations. These  shorter-term assignments are not reflected in GEMS, and the  positions therefore appear vacant.\nThe GEMS data may not reflect Foreign Service employees who have  been temporarily reassigned from one overseas post to another.\nThe GEMS data may show positions as filled although the Foreign  Service employee filling the position has not yet arrived at post.\nTo assess the reliability of the GEMS database, we asked State officials  whether State had made any major changes to the database since our  2012 report, when we assessed the GEMS data to be sufficiently reliable.  State officials indicated that no major changes had been made. We also  tested the data for completeness, confirmed the general accuracy of the  data with officials at selected overseas posts, and interviewed  knowledgeable officials from State\u2019s Office of Resource Management and  Organizational Analysis concerning the data\u2019s reliability. We found the  GEMS data to be reliable for the purpose of determining the numbers and  percentages of vacant Foreign Service positions at overseas posts. We  did not validate whether the total number of authorized overseas Foreign  Service positions was appropriate or met State\u2019s needs.\nWe also reviewed State workforce planning documents and budget  documents, such as State\u2019s Five Year Workforce and Leadership  Succession Plan: Fiscal Years 2016-2020 and Quadrennial Diplomacy  and Development Review. In addition, we reviewed State Office of  Inspector General reports as well as our previous reports on human  capital challenges at State and effective strategic human capital  management across the federal government. In particular, our report  High-Risk Series: Progress on Many High-Risk Areas, While Substantial  Efforts Needed on Others notes that strategic human capital management  is a high-risk issue across the federal government and lists five key  elements as a road map for agency efforts to improve and ultimately  address such issues. For our third objective, we assessed whether  State\u2019s efforts to address vacancies were guided by a corrective action  plan that identifies the root causes of persistent Foreign Service  vacancies at overseas posts and suggests corrective measures to reduce  such vacancies, including steps necessary to implement solutions.\nWe conducted this performance audit from August 2017 to March 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.\nThose standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\n\nAppendix II: Analysis of Vacant Foreign Service Positions at Overseas Posts in Various Categories as of March 31, 2018\n\n\tManagement 10 largest specialist skill groups at overseas posts Security Officer\n\n\tStaffed positions at overseas posts Overseas posts by Overseas Staffing Model category Embassy 1 or 2 655\n\nThe \u201cEconomic\u201d generalist career track includes positions from the \u201cScience Officer\u201d staffing skill  group in the GEMS data.  170 Foreign Service employees were not staffed to one of the six regional bureaus.\n\nAppendix III: Comments from the Department of State\n\nAppendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\n\n\tGAO Contact\n\n\tStaff Acknowledgments\n\nIn addition to the contact named above, Godwin Agbara (Assistant  Director), Ian Ferguson (Analyst-in-Charge), Anthony Costulas, Natalia  Pena, Debbie Chung, Chris Keblitis, Reid Lowe, Justin Fisher, and  Alexander Welsh made key contributions to this report.\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "Why GAO Did This Study\n\nState staffs Foreign Service employees to more than 270 embassies and consulates worldwide to advance U.S. foreign policy and economic interests. In 2009 and 2012, GAO identified ongoing Foreign Service staffing gaps.\nGAO was asked to review State's Foreign Service staffing. This report examines (1) vacancies in State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed State's Global Employment Management System data as of March 2018. The system includes information on Foreign Service and Civil Service positions, including the total number of authorized Foreign Service positions and whether each position is filled or vacant. GAO also reviewed its relevant prior reports and State workforce planning documents. In addition, GAO interviewed State staff at 10 overseas posts, selected on the basis of large numbers of Foreign Service vacancies and diversity in the types of Foreign Service positions that were vacant at these posts, among other factors.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nThe Department of State's (State) data show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts since 2008. According to the data, 13 percent of overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant as of March 2018. This percentage is similar to the percentages GAO reported for 2008 and 2012, when 14 percent of these positions were vacant. In addition, State's data show persistent vacancies at overseas posts in generalist positions that help formulate and implement U.S. foreign policy and in specialist positions that support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts. State's data also show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts with State's highest foreign policy priorities and in regions with security risks that could threaten U.S. foreign policy interests.\nAccording to staff at overseas posts, Foreign Service vacancies adversely affect State's ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy. Staff at overseas posts told us that vacancies increase workloads, contributing to low morale and higher stress for Foreign Service staff and that vacancies in Political and Economic positions\u201420 percent and 16 percent, respectively\u2014limit the reporting on political and economic issues that posts are able to provide to State headquarters. Notably, officials also stated that vacancies in specialist positions may heighten security risks at overseas posts and disrupt post operations. For instance, some overseas post staff said that vacancies in Information Management positions had increased the vulnerability of posts' computer networks to potential cybersecurity attacks and other malicious threats.\nState described various efforts\u2014implemented by multiple offices in the department \u2014to help address overseas Foreign Service vacancies, but these efforts are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. An example of State's efforts is the \u201cHard-to-Fill\u201d program, which allows Civil Service staff an opportunity to fill a Foreign Service vacancy on a single overseas tour. According to GAO's 2017 High-Risk Series report, an agency should design and implement an action plan\u2014integrated across its relevant offices\u2014that defines the root causes of all skills gaps and suggests corrective measures. However, State has not developed such an action plan for reducing persistent overseas Foreign Service vacancies. Without developing an integrated action plan, overseas Foreign Service vacancies may persist. As a result, State's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals and help ensure secure and efficient operations could be adversely impacted.\n\nWhat GAO Recommends\n\nGAO recommends that State develop an integrated action plan that defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts and suggests corrective measures to reduce such vacancies. State concurred with our recommendation and noted that it will take steps to develop an integrated action plan.",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBackground\n\nVA administers its services and programs through three distinct  administrations\u2014Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans  Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. VHA  is the largest property holder within VA and is responsible for overseeing  health care delivery to enrolled veterans and managing all VA medical  facilities. VHA\u2019s VISNs are responsible for overseeing medical facilities,  and VA works with the VISNs and local medical facilities to manage its  real property assets through VA\u2019s capital-planning process.\n\n\t\tResponsibilities for Disposing of Properties\n\nVarious VA offices share responsibilities for managing and disposing of  real properties. Specifically:\nVISNs and local facilities are responsible for identifying, planning,  and managing underutilized and vacant properties, including  executing demolitions of buildings.\nOffice of Capital Asset Management, Engineering, and Support,  within VHA, is responsible for supporting the property disposal efforts  of VISNs and local facilities, including providing funding for  demolitions (if properties are part of a minor construction project or  non-recurring maintenance project).\nOffice of Construction and Facilities Management, within VA\u2019s  Office of Acquisition, Logistics and Construction, is responsible for: (1)  developing and updating policies and procedures on disposal actions  (except enhanced-use leases) and executing them; (2) coordinating  the Steward B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act\u2019s (McKinney- Vento Act) screening process for potential homeless use prior to  disposal; (3) overseeing implementation of required federal  environmental reviews for planning and construction of major projects  and real property actions; and (4) promulgating policy related to  historic preservation, among other things.\nOffice of Asset Enterprise Management (Asset Enterprise Office),  within the VA\u2019s Office of Management, is responsible for: (1) ensuring  local facility disposal requests align with VA policy; (2) reviewing real- property inventory data, including annual disposal plans; (3)  monitoring completion of disposal projects; (4) executing enhanced- use lease-related disposals; and (5) overseeing the Strategic Capital  Investment Planning process, among other responsibilities.\n\n\t\tVA\u2019s Disposal Process\n\nAccording to VA\u2019s guidance on managing underutilized properties and  disposals, the process for managing vacant properties usually begins with  VISNs and local medical facilities. Together, they are responsible for  identifying underutilized real properties and updating this information in  the CAI database, which VA uses to manage its real property.\nVA has also identified and prioritized disposal options VISNs and local  facilities have for determining what to do with vacant and underutilized  properties they have identified. As shown in figure 2, VA\u2019s first priority is  to re-use vacant and underutilized properties within the department. If  properties cannot be re-used, then VA looks at disposal options that  would remove them from its inventory. If no disposal options are feasible,  then VA may choose to close or \u201cmothball\u201d properties.\nProperties in the CAI database with utilization rates that are less than 50  percent\u2014including vacant properties\u2014are candidates for disposal, and  VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers are required to develop a disposal  plan for all vacant buildings or update an existing plan for these facilities  each year.\nVA may choose from several options to dispose of vacant and  underutilized properties, including: entering into an enhanced-use lease,  demolition, like-kind exchange, transfer of real properties to the state for  nursing home use, declaring excess property for disposals through GSA,  or mothball, among others. (See fig. 3.) The disposal process differs  depending on the disposal method selected.\nAs part of the disposal process, VA is required to take certain actions,  including conducting environmental reviews and considering the effects of  its actions on historic properties. Accordingly, VA conducts \u201cdue  diligence\u201d reviews on vacant properties, and these reviews include  complying with selected federal requirements described in table 1 below.\n\n\t\tNumber and Characteristics of Disposals\n\nFrom fiscal years 2012 through 2017, VA disposed of 577 properties  (including 471 buildings with about 5-million gross square feet), primarily  through demolition of medical facilities and enhanced-use lease  agreements (see fig. 4). These two methods accounted for the disposal  of 3.6-million gross square feet of building space. VA used other disposal  methods, such as transferring property to states for nursing home care or negotiating a sale, for the remaining 50 properties, as shown in figure 4  below. As of July 2018, VA reported initiating the disposal or re-use of  167 of the 430 vacant buildings the Secretary identified for disposal in  June 2017.\nOf the 471 building disposals from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, VA  disposed of 203 buildings in fiscal year 2012 alone in contrast to 61  building disposals in fiscal year 2017, as shown in figure 5. A VA official  attributed the decline in disposals from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year  2013 to limitations placed on VA\u2019s enhanced-use lease authority in  2012.\nThe characteristics of the 471 buildings VA disposed of varied from fiscal  years 2012 through 2017. The majority (331 out of 471) was offices,  housing quarters, service buildings, and warehouses; other buildings  included hospitals, laboratories, and outpatient healthcare facilities. VA  reported many of these buildings as historic, as shown in figure 6. More  than a third of the vacant buildings designated as non-historic were  demolished. Almost a third of the buildings\u2014primarily housing quarters\u2014 were disposed of using enhanced-use leases.\n\n\tVA Is Addressing Some of Its Ongoing Disposal Challenges but Lacks Procedures to Manage Property Disposals\n\nVA officials and stakeholders we spoke with said that administering both  environmental and historic reviews are key challenges for disposals. Two  other ongoing challenges\u2014the marketability of VA properties and  prioritizing funding for disposals\u2014were also mentioned as factors  impeding VA\u2019s property disposal efforts. As part of VA\u2019s initiative to begin  the re-use or disposal process for 430 vacant properties within 2 years,  VA has begun addressing its environmental and historic review  challenges. For example, VA established a working group to assist  VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers in conducting these reviews. While  VA is addressing challenges related to these reviews, limited interest in  purchasing or leasing VA properties and competition for funding with  other important VA projects directly related to veterans\u2019 care are ongoing  challenges that continue to hinder disposal efforts.\n\n\t\tVA is Taking Steps to Facilitate Environmental and Historic Reviews, but Properties\u2019 Marketability and Competing Priorities Remain Challenging\n\n\t\t\tEnvironmental and Historic Reviews\n\nVA officials and stakeholders we spoke with cited the time it takes to  complete the required environmental and historic reviews as a challenge  in managing the disposal process. Although VA does not maintain data  on how long these reviews can take or how long it takes to dispose of its  properties, in our review of 31 selected properties, we found variation in  the timespan to conduct environmental and historic reviews. The  environmental reviews of these properties took about 2 years on average  to complete, depending on the condition of the property. For example,   an environmental review of temporary storage facilities in Biloxi took  about a year, as no environmental issues were identified. In another case,  it took about 2 years to conduct an environmental review of VA\u2019s  Cincinnati-Fort Thomas property, as asbestos and lead paint were  identified during the course of the review. For those disposals requiring  historic reviews, we found that it took about 5 years on average,  depending on the complexity of the disposal. For example, it took 5  years to complete a historic review of the St. Louis, Jefferson Barracks  property due to the need to collaborate with multiple stakeholders,  including the neighboring Army National Guard base, the state\u2019s historic  preservation office, local community council, community organizations,  and many veteran service organizations; and addressing the adverse  effects on historic properties, according to VA officials. VA officials and  stakeholders we spoke with stated that due to lack of staff expertise and  resources, VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers may choose to contract  out these reviews, but procuring contractors may also add time to the  disposal process, as facility managers need to define the terms of work  and identify contractors.\nFurther, environmental and historic reviews can affect VA\u2019s decision- making process with regard to choosing a disposal method, potentially  lengthening the time it takes for disposal. For example, VA officials told us  that they began a historic review on the Pittsburgh-Highland Drive  property in 2012 but discontinued the review in 2013, partially due to  disagreements with historic preservation stakeholders about the proposed  demolition of some historic buildings. After 4 years, in 2017, VA decided  to declare the property as excess and turn it over to GSA for disposal.  According to VA officials, this required a different historic review, as it  entailed a different disposal method. GSA is currently administering the  additional historic review of this property.\nVA has begun taking actions to reduce the time it takes to conduct  environmental and historic reviews as part of VA\u2019s initiative to begin the  process of re-using or disposing of 430 vacant buildings within 2 years.  For example, VA worked with the Advisory Council on Historic  Preservation to obtain a program comment alternative to reduce time  spent with historic preservation stakeholders when consulting on  \u201cancillary utilitarian support buildings and structures,\u201d such as a boiler  plant or a sewage plant. VA officials also told us that they established a  headquarters-level working group consisting of experts in historic  preservation and environmental reviews as well as real property  transactions to assist VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers in  administering disposals, including conducting these reviews, and in  moving them forward. VA officials also told us that they awarded four  regional contracts with contractors to complete the environmental and  historic reviews and expedite the disposal process.\nVA officials and historic preservation stakeholders we spoke with also  said they can have disagreements on how to meet the historic review  requirements, and such disputes can add time to the review process. The  historic preservation stakeholders commented that VA does not consult  with them early in the disposal\u2019s decision-making process and does not  provide adequate information on the adverse effects of demolishing a  historic property as well as other potential methods through which VA  could dispose of a property. VA officials we spoke with stated that they  have been consulting with historic preservation stakeholders on all  disposal projects as required.\nTo improve collaboration and communication between VA and external  stakeholders, VA developed a toolkit in June 2017 on how to effectively  communicate with stakeholders. This communications toolkit responded  to our recommendation for VA to develop and distribute guidance for  VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers to use when communicating with  stakeholders on facility alignment changes, and we subsequently closed  this recommendation.\n\n\t\t\tCompeting Priorities\n\nVA officials and stakeholders we spoke with also pointed out that  competing priorities for VA funds is another remaining challenge. VA  officials stated that projects to demolish buildings compete for funding  with other capital projects, such as renovating inpatient units. Since VA\u2019s  mission is to provide health care services, demolishing buildings is not as  high a priority compared to other projects that may lead to providing  better health care services.\nVA officials also told us that competing priorities can affect how long it  takes to dispose of vacant properties. If a demolition project is part of a  construction project, then VA may give it a relatively high priority for  funding. For example, at VA\u2019s Dayton campus it took about a year from  when VA requested funding in 2016 to demolish two historic buildings in  2017. A VA official said that due to a $1 million donation to build a Fisher  House on VA\u2019s Dayton campus, funds were prioritized to demolish two  national historic landmark buildings to make space available for  construction of the Fisher House. However, according to other VA  officials, demolition projects in and of themselves do not rank well for  funding; such rankings can affect the time it takes for disposal.\nFor example, a VA official said that VA had initially planned to demolish a  temporary building on the Cleveland Wade Park campus sometime during  the 2012-to-2013 time frame; however, VA did not demolish the  temporary building until 2017, in part due to the longer than expected time  it took for VA to allocate funds to this project. If funds are not available for  demolition, a building can remain vacant for many years. For example,  VA closed several properties on its Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center  campus in North Hills, CA, after they sustained major damage from the  1994 Northridge earthquake. According to VA officials, competing funding  priorities, among other factors, contributed to the long wait to demolish  these vacant properties, which had not been disposed of as of October  2018 (see fig. 7). VA officials also noted that waiting for VA to allocate  funds to demolish properties can result in additional potential cost later  on. For instance, VA officials mentioned that since buildings on the  Sepulveda campus have been vacant for many years, they now qualified  for historic status, requiring them to undergo a historic review\u2014a  requirement that could have been avoided if VA had demolished them  more than 20 years ago when they were originally identified for disposal.\nVA officials and stakeholders we spoke with identified property  characteristics that affect the marketability of VA properties\u2014historic  status, deficient physical conditions, location, unusable building  configuration, and repair costs\u2014as barriers for disposal. This is a long- standing challenge that limits VA\u2019s ability to re-use or dispose of vacant  and underutilized properties. In our recent analysis of VA\u2019s CAI data, we  found that a majority of VA\u2019s vacant properties (about 78 percent) from  fiscal years 2012 through 2017 have an historic status, and the average  age of those vacant properties is about 91 years old. As discussed  earlier, historic reviews can be lengthy and can make the disposal  process challenging, according to VA officials. Also, older buildings are  likely to have configurations that are difficult to use or are in need of  significant repair.\nVA officials and stakeholders said that the location of VA properties limits  disposal options. For example, a VA official told us that demolition is  sometimes the only disposal option available when a deficient building is  located on an existing VA campus and cannot be re-used or disposed of  and removed from VA\u2019s inventory. VA officials also stated that historic  buildings are frequently located in the middle of a campus and sometimes  cannot be easily demolished due to the historic designation (see fig. 8).  In these cases, VA will close and \u201cmothball\u201d the building to minimize  maintenance and operations costs and let the buildings sit vacant as an  interim measure. VA officials commented that there are also safety and  security challenges associated with disposing of or re-using a building  located in the middle of a VA campus. For example, a local facility  manager told us that when two of its buildings on campus were leased  out to an organization on a short-term lease for use as dormitories, young  adults from the dormitories gained access to private inpatient areas,  violating patients\u2019 privacy. This is consistent with our previous findings  that many disposable VA properties located in the middle of medical  campuses draw limited private sector interest making some disposal  options challenging.\nVA officials and stakeholders we spoke with\u2014including commercial real  estate experts\u2014also indicated that it can be difficult to attract developers  for several reasons. In one instance, a VA official and a stakeholder we  spoke with told us that it took multiple years to identify developers that  would take on environmental mitigation efforts as part of the negotiated  sale and transfer of VA\u2019s properties to the City of Fort Thomas, Kentucky.  According to a stakeholder, developers were not willing to take on the  cost and risk of environmental mitigation without a title to the property and  no guaranteed income from the property. VA, however, could not transfer  the property title to a third party without first meeting federal standards for  cleaning up the environmental hazards on the properties. While the  issue was ultimately addressed, it took several years to complete the  deal.\n\n\t\tVA Lacks Clear Procedures to Manage Property Disposals\n\nAnother challenge that VA officials and stakeholders raised was VA\u2019s lack  of clear disposal procedures. Several VA officials and stakeholders we  spoke with stated that it is unclear what specific steps need to be taken for disposals, what are the targeted time frames for completing those steps, and who is responsible for completing them.\nVA\u2019s guidance on managing underutilized properties and disposals  provides policies and procedures on a portfolio level, such as VA\u2019s  priorities for disposing of vacant properties and the different disposal  options available. However, VA\u2019s guidance does not specify sequential  steps and actions that need to be taken at the project level to plan,  implement, and execute property disposals for VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019  managers. Further, a VA official in headquarters told us that VA does  not have formal guidance on selecting any particular disposal methods.\nWhile we found that documentation on policies and procedures exists for  some specific disposal methods, such as enhanced-use lease projects,  VA officials told us that policies and procedures for other disposal actions,  such as transferring or declaring property as excess and disposing of it  through GSA, are not documented. A VA official in headquarters told us  that informal guidance may exist in some VISNs, but no standardized  procedures on managing a disposal project is available. VA officials said  there are no step-by-step procedures to refer to when using a disposal  options more complex than demolishing a building. A VISN facilities\u2019  manager we spoke with further pointed out that a decision-tree to help  plan, implement, and execute for the different disposal methods does not  exists to help local facilities navigate through VA\u2019s decentralized and  complex disposal process.\nVA officials told us that its disposal process is decentralized, an approach  that can contribute to unclear procedures for disposal projects. According  to VA officials, VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers are responsible for  making disposal decisions, developing a disposal plan, and executing the  disposal. As previously discussed, different VA program offices are  responsible for different disposal actions, depending on the disposal  method that VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers are considering. VA  officials noted that this decentralized approach to managing disposals can  make it difficult for VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers as well as local  stakeholders to know when or how best to coordinate with the appropriate  VA offices. A real property stakeholder we spoke with also noted that  common uncertainties in working with VA, such as its lack of a clear and  timely disposal process, can hinder developers\u2019 interests in VA properties.  Specifically, the stakeholder stated that VA\u2019s decision-making process is  divided among different entities within VA, a situation that may add time  to the disposal process, and stated that having a clear and timely disposal  process may provide a level of certainty for developers.\nVA officials and stakeholders also said that in some cases, VISNs\u2019 and  local facilities\u2019 managers may lack the knowledge and experience to  manage disposals. For example, VA officials told us that while facility  managers generally know what actions are needed to demolish  properties, they are not familiar with actions that need to be taken for  transferring or selling properties to a third party or turning excess property  over to GSA for disposal. VA officials also mentioned staff turnover and  the infrequency of disposals as contributing factors to staff\u2019s lack of  knowledge on procedures for disposing of properties. For example, two  facilities\u2019 managers we spoke with said that in their many years of working  for VA they have never reported a property as excess and disposed of it  through GSA, until recently. VA officials and stakeholders further noted  that VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers may lack expertise conducting  historic and environmental reviews as they are usually engineers, who  are not experts on environmental and historic issues. For example, a  VISN facility manager informed us that a local facility manager was not  familiar with administering an environmental review, a lack that led to a  misstep in the review and duplication of work and added time to the  disposal process.\nWhile VA has policies and guidance on historic and environmental  reviews, our review of these documents showed that they do not provide  guidance on how to make decisions, what actions to take, what are the targeted time frames for taking those actions, and who should be completing those actions.\nFurther, while VA officials with experience in disposals may estimate how  long these reviews can take, VA does not have documented guidance on  estimated time frames (milestones) for taking those actions.\nFederal internal controls call for documentation to help management  oversee execution of procedures by establishing and communicating the  \u201cwho, what, when, where, and why\u201d to personnel. Documentation also  provides a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk  of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel and a means to  communicate that knowledge as needed to external parties, such as  external auditors or interested third parties. Federal internal controls also  call for management to define objectives in specific terms\u2014in this case,  disposal actions\u2014so they are understood at all levels of the entity. This  understanding involves clearly defining what is to be achieved, who is to  achieve it, how it will be achieved, and the estimated time frames for  achievement. Without procedural documentation that describes the  disposal options and the actions needed to carry out the disposal,  including estimated time frames, it is difficult for VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019  managers to plan, implement, and execute the different disposal options  available and efficiently dispose of vacant properties.\nA procedural document at the project level may include information on  who is authorized to make decisions and include estimated time frames  around historic and environmental reviews to ensure timely and  appropriate disposal of VA properties. For example, VA officials with  experience in disposals estimated that it should take about 6-to-8 months  for a property disposal, if there are no environmental and historic issues  involved and funding is available. For disposals where environmental and  historic reviews are needed, those officials told us it should take about 2- to-4 years from when VA decided to dispose of a property to complete the  disposal. According to facilities managers we spoke to, additional  procedural documentation at the project level could help VISNs\u2019 and local  facilities\u2019 managers navigate through the complex disposal process and  avoid missteps or delays in the disposal of vacant properties.\n\n\tVA Enhanced Its Collection of Data on Vacant Properties but Lacks Key Information to Track and Monitor Disposals VA Has Taken Steps to Enhance How It Collects Data on Vacant Properties\n\nTo enhance the monitoring of its real property and to meet reporting  requirements, VA officials told us VA has taken steps in the last 6 years to  improve its real property inventory and the data it collects on its vacant  properties, including properties VA has identified for disposal. These  steps include:\nRequiring VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers to verify and  certify the accuracy of the information in the CAI. VA\u2019s Asset  Enterprise Office sends out an annual call for facility managers to  verify and certify the validity of vacant property data for each of the  facilities.\nRequiring VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers to make ongoing  updates to the CAI database. VA\u2019s annual data-call memo requires  these managers to continuously update the data as they take actions.  Facility managers we spoke to stated they update this information  regularly, including when actively planning disposal projects and  individual projects are complete. One facility manager told us that  VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise Office is \u201cactively pushing\u201d local managers to  update this information, and the data in the CAI have improved as a  result.\nGenerating \u201cdiscrepancy reports\u201d to identify problems with  inaccurate or outdated property data in the CAI. VA officials in  headquarters told us that facility managers review these reports and  explain any identified discrepancies regarding vacant properties,  including those identified for disposal. VA officials told us they then  correct any errors. Discrepancy reports include checks on whether  facility managers have specified a disposal method for each disposal,  estimated an associated disposal\u2019s cost, and entered a planned future  year for the disposal.\nRefining the database by, for example, adding new \u201cbusiness  rules\u201d to limit user errors. VA officials told us that since 2012 it has  implemented program changes and new business rules to the CAI  database to address inaccuracies in the data, including data that  support disposal information. For example, a VA official in  headquarters told us that to decrease the number of errors caused by  users entering data more than once, the database now limits the  number of times users may enter the same information. This prevents  multiple data entries appearing for, for example, the year a building  was built, according to VA officials. VA officials in headquarters also  told us they developed similar business rules to identify \u201cclearly  wrong\u201d data entries and duplicative data. For instance, users cannot  enter letters in numeric fields which, they told us, has led to fewer  errors.\n\n\t\tVA Does Not Collect Key Information to Track and Monitor Property Disposals\n\nAlthough VA has enhanced its data collection efforts for vacant  properties, we found that VA does not collect all the information  necessary for its headquarters officials to track and monitor the disposal  of VA\u2019s vacant properties. As part of its annual call for validating data, VA  requires facility managers to record certain information about disposals in  the CAI, including: which buildings are identified for disposal, whether a disposal plan is in place, when the disposal is to occur, what type of disposal method is to be used, and what are the costs associated with the disposal.\nHowever, VA does not have the ability in its CAI to collect detailed data  on the status of disposal projects\u2014specifically, data fields for facility  managers to input detailed information on the status of: (1) disposal  actions, (2) due diligence reviews, and (3) approvals, such as  environmental permits that are necessary to complete the disposal.  Since CAI does not have this information, VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise Office,  as part of the Secretary\u2019s initiative to begin the re-use or disposal process  of 430 buildings, developed a standalone spreadsheet to track and  monitor the disposal status of these buildings. Then, according to officials  in VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise Office, they had to ask local facility managers  what was the status of each individual disposal.\nFederal internal-control standards state that management should use  quality information to achieve an entity\u2019s objectives and establish and  operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system and  evaluate the results. This includes management obtaining data on a  timely basis and using it for effective monitoring, which includes controls  to achieve complete and accurate data. While the Secretary\u2019s initiative  has raised the priority of tracking and monitoring VA\u2019s real property  disposals, the CAI does not contain key information to improve VA\u2019s  routine tracking as called for in internal controls. A key official in VA\u2019s  Asset Enterprise Office told us that officials there usually leave it to local  facilities to track key information and that the CAI currently does not  collect this information. Without incorporating information needed to better  track and monitor disposals through VA\u2019s primary real property tracking  database\u2014CAI\u2014VA may not be able to efficiently track and monitor its  real property disposals going forward after the Secretary\u2019s initiative is  completed. VA officials in headquarters told us that without data on the  actions and status of disposals, including steps taken to complete  environmental and historic reviews, they are unable to track and monitor  the progress of disposal projects\u2014including the length of time these  reviews take\u2014and to identify any areas where management may assist  local facilities in disposing of properties. For instance, as previously  mentioned, VA officials in headquarters told us they used the information  gathered as part of the 430 re-use or disposal initiative to identify and  award contracts to perform environmental and historic reviews and, as a  result, more quickly expedited the disposal process.\nIn addition, VA officials in headquarters do not collect documentation,  such as environmental and historical review documents, that could allow  headquarters staff to verify the status of disposal projects. As mentioned,  federal internal controls state that management should use quality  information to achieve an entity\u2019s objective, including obtaining data on a  timely basis and using these data for effective monitoring, which includes  controls to achieve complete and accurate data. Further, VA requires  VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers to record a planned or completed  disposal in the CAI, including updating information as changes occur.  However, a key official in VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise Office told us the CAI  database does not currently have enough space for facility managers to  upload supporting documentation, including environmental and historic  review documents. As part of the Secretary\u2019s initiative to begin the re-use  or disposal process for 430 buildings, VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise Office set up  a website to collect and exchange documents, such as environmental and  historic review documents from local facility managers. This process  allowed VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise staff to verify the disposal information of  the properties in the spreadsheet using this collected information. While  VA created a website to exchange documentation as part of the 430 re- use or disposal initiative, this website is separate from CAI and was  created because VA had not previously collected supporting documents  in CAI. However, a VA official told us that when they compared  information they collected from the website, they found the information in  CAI is not always correct and appropriately updated.\nAs we have previously found, documentation provides a means to retain  organizational knowledge while mitigating the risk of having that  knowledge limited to a few personnel. Documentation can also ensure  that knowledge gets communicated to external parties, such as external  auditors. As previously mentioned, some VA staff lack expertise and  organizational knowledge to properly document a variety of disposal  options. VA also experiences frequent staff turnover. These issues,  together with the inability of facilities\u2019 managers to upload disposal-related  documents directly into CAI, puts VA at risk of losing valuable information  about the disposal process. For example, according to a stakeholder we  spoke with, VA could not readily provide information about consulting  stakeholders on historic properties, as required by historic review  requirements. A VA official told us that after contacting facility managers  for information about specific disposal projects as part of the 430  initiative, they found disposal procedures were not consistently  documented and, in some cases, documents were missing.\nVA officials in headquarters provided us with a draft proposal to enhance  the CAI in several ways, including:  to add specific data fields for dates, including completion dates for  reviews and  to increase the capacity of the CAI to allow facility managers to upload  disposal documentation, including environmental and historic review  documentation.\nHowever, the proposed changes do not include some key information,  such as the start dates for compliance reviews, so VA cannot monitor and  track when the reviews began and how disposals are progressing.  Additionally, a VA official we spoke with could not provide a specific time  frame for increasing the capacity of CAI, as VA is currently working on  developing space requirements that are needed to increase capacity and  help estimate a time frame.\n\n\tConclusions\n\nGiven that the number of VA\u2019s vacant buildings has been generally  increasing in the last 6 years and the implementation of the VA Asset and  Infrastructure Review Act of 2018 could lead to more unneeded buildings,  effectively managing VA\u2019s real property disposal is crucial. Otherwise, VA  may maintain a large inventory of vacant buildings that may be costly to  secure and maintain. While effectively disposing of excess and  underutilized property has been a long-standing challenge for VA, the  agency has taken some positive actions, such as examining ways to  streamline the historic review process, having some documented  procedures, and improving data collection efforts on vacant properties.  However, without documented procedures for all the disposal options to  assist VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers in planning, implementing,  and executing disposals and navigating the complex property-disposal  process, VISNs and local facilities\u2014which are responsible for managing  their real property\u2014may continue to struggle to facilitate property  disposals efficiently. Also, without important information on the status of  disposal projects and supporting documents, it is unclear how VA can  monitor and track disposals, including identifying any areas where  management can assist in the disposal of its vacant properties.\n\n\tRecommendations for Executive Action\n\nWe are making the following three recommendations to the VA:  1.  The Secretary should develop clear procedures for each of VA\u2019s  disposal options to help facilities\u2019 managers plan, implement, and  execute projects to dispose of vacant and unneeded properties.  (Recommendation 1)  2.  As VA implements its plans to enhance the CAI to collect key data on  disposal projects, the Secretary should collect data on disposal status  information and time frames (e.g., environmental and historical  reviews\u2019 starting dates) to ensure VA has the information it needs to  track the length of the disposal process and identify any areas where  management may assist local facilities in implementing property  disposals. (Recommendation 2)  3.  As VA pursues its plans to enhance the CAI, the Secretary should  increase the capacity of the CAI to allow local facilities to upload  disposal-specific documentation, such as environmental- and  historical-review documents, to ensure all documentation related to a  property\u2019s disposal is available to appropriate parties, including VA  officials. (Recommendation 3)\n\n\tAgency Comments\n\nWe provided a draft of this report to VA for review and comment. In  written comments, reproduced in appendix II, VA concurred with our  recommendations and stated that it has begun or is planning to take  actions to address them. VA also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of the Veteran\u2019s Administration, and other  interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the  GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nIf you or your staff members have any questions regarding this report,  please contact Andrew Von Ah at (202) 512-2834 or vonaha@gao.gov.

Key contributors to  this report are listed in appendix III.\n\nAppendix I: Objective, Scope, and Methodology\n\nThis report examines the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA)  efforts to dispose of properties, including the management of its real  property disposals. Specifically, we address: (1) the challenges VA faces  disposing of its vacant property and how it is addressing those challenges  and (2) the extent to which VA is tracking and monitoring the disposal of  its properties.\nTo address these objectives, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations,  policies, handbooks, and other documents related to VA\u2019s real property  management, including VA\u2019s Handbook and Directive on Managing  Underutilized Real Property Assets, including Options for Reuse and  Disposal and VA\u2019s Capital Asset Inventory User Guide as well as VA\u2019s  annual budget submissions to Congress to fully understand VA\u2019s disposal  process. To examine the full scope and extent of VA\u2019s vacant and  disposed of properties, we obtained and analyzed data from VA\u2019s Capital  Asset Inventory for fiscal years 2012 through 2017 and assessed their  reliability. To assess the reliability of VA\u2019s data we: (1) looked for any  missing data, outliers, or other obvious data errors; (2) reviewed existing  documentation about the data and the system that produced them; (3)  reviewed VA\u2019s processes for checking and validating the data; and (4)  interviewed officials knowledgeable about the data. We found the data to  be reliable for our purposes of identifying the number and type of vacant  and disposed of buildings and the characteristics of those buildings.\nTo identify challenges that VA faces when disposing of property and how  VA is addressing them, we selected a non-generalizable sample of 31  properties using data from VA\u2019s Capital Asset Inventory as mentioned  above. The 31 properties we selected were either completed in fiscal year  2017 or planning was under way for disposal, including through the  General Services Administration (GSA). Specifically, we selected  properties that:  captured a range of disposal methods available to VA using VA\u2019s  current process for disposal,  included both recently planned and completed disposals to observe  disposals in different phases of planning and were likely documented  by current VA staff, and  represented a variety of building and disposal characteristics,  including associated disposal costs, historic status, age, and size.\nThe challenges faced by these selected properties cannot be used to  make inferences about all VA properties. However, they illustrate the  range of challenges that VA faces in disposing of properties.\nIn addition, to help identify disposal challenges VA faces, including those  challenges that were identified as a lengthy time frame for disposal, we  obtained and reviewed documents related to the 31 selected properties,  including environmental review reports and historic review documents.  We used environmental and historic review documents to help estimate  the timespan for disposals, including time frames to conduct these  reviews. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with VA officials  and external stakeholders, who were involved or knowledgeable about  the disposal of these selected properties and are familiar with VA\u2019s  disposal process. These included interviews with facility managers from  VA\u2019s Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) and local facilities who  were knowledgeable about the disposal of the 31 selected properties.  This group represented 7 of VA\u2019s 18 VISNs and 10 local medical facilities,  including two local medical facilities\u2014Perry Point (MD) and Sepulveda  (CA)\u2014with planned disposal projects\u2014we visited. We also interviewed  external stakeholders who included officials from the GSA; veterans  service organizations (e.g., Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American  Legion); a local community that purchased VA properties, a major  commercial real estate company; and historic preservation groups (e.g.  Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the National Conference of  State Historic Preservation Officers) as well as selected State Historic  Preservation Officers to obtain their perspectives on VA\u2019s disposal  challenges. To identify common challenges, along with illustrative  examples and lengthy time frames, we reviewed and analyzed  documents from the 31 properties we selected as well as interviews with  VA officials and external stakeholders. This analysis included one analyst  reading through all of the documents and interviews, creating a list of  challenges mentioned, and then a subsequent analyst verifying this list.  To identify steps VA has taken to address challenges, we reviewed  documents and interviewed officials from VA\u2019s Office of Asset Enterprise  Management and its Office of Construction & Facilities Management as  well as Veterans Health Administration\u2019s Office of Capital Asset  Management and Engineering Support. We then assessed VA\u2019s efforts to  address these challenges against applicable federal internal control  standards.\nTo determine the extent to which VA is tracking and monitoring the  disposal of its vacant properties, we reviewed the current data fields in  VA\u2019s Capital Asset Inventory, as well as VA\u2019s planning and guidance  documents, including the Fiscal Year 2017 Capital Asset Inventory and  Disposal Plans Updates (Annual Call Memo). In addition, we interviewed  VA officials in headquarters, including VA\u2019s Office of Asset Enterprise  Management and the Office of Construction and Facilities Management to  determine the extent to which VA is tracking and monitoring the disposal  of its vacant properties. We obtained and reviewed a copy of VA\u2019s data  discrepancy report for fiscal year 2016 that VA uses to verify data and  track and monitor vacant properties and disposals. We also reviewed  VA\u2019s planning documents, including a tracking spreadsheet that VA is  using to monitor the disposal of vacant properties. In addition, we  interviewed VA officials, including facility managers from VISNs and local  facilities, to obtain their perspective on VA\u2019s efforts to track and monitor  disposals, specifically. Subsequently, we assessed VA\u2019s plan to track and  monitor these properties against applicable federal internal controls.\nWe conducted our work from November 2017 to December 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\n\nAppendix II Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nAppendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\n\n\tContact\n\n\tStaff Acknowledgments\n\nIn addition to the individual named above, Kyle Browning; Cathy Colwell  (Assistant Director); Gina Hoover; Jennifer Kim (Analyst in Charge); Brian  Lepore; Jeff Mayhew; Nitin Rao; Malika Rice; Minette Richardson; Todd  Schartung; Michelle Weathers; and Crystal Wesco made key  contributions to this report.\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "Why GAO Did This Study\n\nVA is one of the largest federal property-holding agencies, and its inventory of vacant buildings has generally increased over the last 6 years. Disposing of its excess properties has been a long-standing challenge.\nGAO was asked to review how VA manages its real property disposals. This report addresses: (1) the challenges VA faces in disposing of its vacant properties and how it is addressing those challenges and (2) the extent to which VA is tracking and monitoring the disposal of its vacant properties.\nGAO reviewed VA's policies and planning documents regarding property disposals. GAO also selected 31 properties that were either disposed of or planned for disposal in fiscal year 2017, among other selection criteria. GAO interviewed VA officials and stakeholders involved in the disposal of the 31 selected properties and familiar with VA's disposal process, including steps VA is taking to address challenges.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nConducting required environmental and historic reviews in a timely manner is among the challenges the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) faces in its real property disposal process. These reviews include assessing the potential effects of property disposals on the environment and historic preservation. VA is taking steps to address these ongoing challenges. For example, VA has established a working group consisting of experts in historic preservation, environmental reviews, and real property to assist facilities' managers in expediting disposals. However, other ongoing challenges remain, including the marketability of VA properties and VA's lack of clear procedures for property disposals. While VA has guidance on disposals at the broad portfolio level, GAO determined that this guidance does not contain step-by-step procedures at the project level to assist facilities' managers to plan, implement, and execute disposals for the different disposal options. (See figure.) For example, a number of managers told GAO that they were not familiar with actions to take when transferring properties to a third party or turning over excess property to the General Services Administration for disposal. VA officials commented that facilities' managers do not frequently dispose of properties, so a procedural document outlining the steps and who is responsible for taking those steps may help staff navigate more complex disposal processes and avoid missteps and delays.\nVA has enhanced its data collection on vacant properties, but the agency does not collect information needed to track and monitor disposal projects at the headquarters level. For example, VA requires facilities' managers to verify and certify the validity of vacant property data in the database used to manage real property\u2014the Capital Asset Inventory. On disposal projects, however, VA lacks certain information, such as the status of environmental or historical reviews, to monitor progress. According to VA, the Capital Asset Inventory currently does not have enough capacity to collect key information and supporting documentation. VA officials said they plan to increase the capacity, but VA has not yet included some key information in the Capital Asset Inventory that could enable VA to monitor the progress of disposals. Without information on the status of disposal projects, VA cannot readily track and monitor its progress and identify areas where facilities' managers may need additional assistance.\n\nWhat GAO Recommends\n\nGAO is making three recommendations. These include developing disposal procedures for facilities' managers to help plan, implement, and execute disposal projects and collecting key information on the status of disposal projects, as VA implements its plans to increase the capacity of VA's Capital Asset Inventory. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBackground\n\n\t\tCBP and Partner Agency Processing of Imported Goods\n\nImported goods flow into the U.S. market through a process that CBP  facilitates and enforces, in collaboration with other federal agencies and  with companies, including customs brokers, engaged in international  trade. Imported goods enter the United States at more than 300 ports by  air, land, or sea. The processing of imported goods includes three stages:  pre-arrival, arrival/cargo release, and post-release.\nPre-arrival. Before goods leave their country of origin, importers and  shipping companies file paperwork and provide required advance  electronic information for CBP to review.\nArrival/cargo release. Importers or brokers file entry documents  when goods reach a U.S. port of entry. At the ports, CBP and other  agencies with regulatory responsibilities review documents and may  examine the goods for import security and trade enforcement  purposes. Some goods selected for examination may be deemed  nonadmissible because of trade law or other violations. Admissible  goods are released from the port and enter into U.S. commerce.\nPost-release. After goods are released from a port, importers or  brokers file additional entry summary documents, which CBP reviews  to ensure compliance with trade laws. CBP verifies importers\u2019 cargo  classifications and calculation of customs duties, taxes, and fees  owed, taking action when needed. CBP and other agencies may  determine that entered goods are noncompliant, thus triggering post- release enforcement action.\nFigure1 summarizes agency roles at these three stages of import  processing.\n\n\t\tACE Development and Implementation, 1994\u2013 2013\n\nCBP initiated planning and preliminary development of ACE in 1994,  following the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement  Implementation Act. Title VI of the act required the creation of a national  customs automation program that would allow electronic processing of  commercial imports. According to CBP, its existing electronic system for  processing imports\u2014the Automated Commercial System (ACS), which  became operational in 1984\u2014used antiquated hardware and software  and, because of limited processing capability, was increasingly difficult  and expensive to operate. In addition, despite ACS\u2019s availability, CBP  continued to rely heavily on paper documents.\nThe following year, a multi-agency task force launched an effort to  develop the International Trade Data System\u2014a government-wide  system for reporting data used to clear imports and exports\u2014and efforts  to develop ITDS and ACE were subsequently integrated. The 2006 SAFE  Port Act mandated the creation of ITDS to provide a \u201csingle portal\u201d trade  data system, to be implemented no later than the date when ACE is fully  implemented. CBP initially planned to deploy ACE incrementally from  1998 through 2005. According to CBP officials, after substantial  difficulties, CBP awarded a contract to begin implementing ACE in 2001  and began deploying ACE capabilities in 2003. However, continued  slow progress led DHS to halt all new ACE development in 2010. A CBP  acquisition decision memorandum issued at that time stated that the  scope and complexity of ACE projects had been consistently  underestimated during the period leading up to this decision.\nDHS authorized CBP to renew work on ACE in 2013, after CBP had  completed a revision of ACE\u2019s schedule, cost, and performance goals.  This \u201crebaselining\u201d of ACE included adopting the agile approach to  system development, which involves segmenting development and  deployment into small consecutive stages, with frequent opportunities to  test new capabilities and confirm that they meet requirements. CBP\u2019s new  plan called for completing core ACE capabilities to allow CBP and partner  agencies to employ the system in all phases of import and export  processing by November 2016, 11 years later than initially planned. A  February 2014 Executive Order, as well as provisions in TFTEA,  subsequently reinforced this commitment to complete the system before  the end of 2016.\nIn rebaselining ACE, CBP consulted with partner agencies and trade  community representatives to identify the core trade processing  capabilities needed for the system to achieve full operational capacity,  according to CBP officials. CBP officials stated that these capabilities are  laid out in an internal 2013 CBP document describing, in general terms,  key activities, processes, and functions that must be performed to  automate import and export processing and improve targeting and  security. We use \u201ccore ACE capabilities\u201d to refer to activities, processes,  and functions that CBP has defined as core.\n\n\tCBP Has Implemented Core ACE Capabilities but Delayed Completion Several Times\n\nAfter revising its schedule, cost, and performance goals for ACE in 2013,  CBP developed and deployed most of the capabilities that it defined as  core ACE. On February 27, 2018, CBP announced that it had deployed  the last of the major scheduled core trade processing capabilities.  However, CBP delayed completion of these capabilities several times and  has deferred deployment of collections\u2014a capability for collecting import  duties, taxes, and fees\u2014while it considers alternative approaches to  make this capability operational.\nUsing the agile approach, CBP began deploying new ACE capabilities in  November 2013, introducing elements iteratively every few months. For  example, the November 2013 deployment included functions related to  the pre-arrival and arrival/cargo release phases of import processing,  initial steps to support two agencies in pilot testing ACE participation, and  a number of efforts to resolve technical problems. By mid-2016, CBP had  deployed all core pre-arrival and arrival/cargo release capabilities, but  several post-release capabilities remained to be deployed. In June 2016,  CBP officials reported that the program would not complete several key  events by November 2016 as planned and declared a cost and schedule  breach; in November 2016, CBP rebaselined ACE again. CBP  subsequently reported that it expected to finish deploying post-release  core ACE capabilities by January 2017, but the agency was unable to  complete this deployment as planned. In April 2017, CBP officials  reported that the program was again in breach, and CBP subsequently  moved the target date for completing deployment of remaining core  capabilities to July 2017.\nReconciliation, Liquidation, and Drawback  During reconciliation, preliminary data on  import transactions provided to CBP at the time  of entry (such as the dollar value of imported  goods) may be updated.  During liquidation, import transactions are  finalized and duty, taxes, and fees due to CBP  are determined.   During drawback, exporters may be able to  claim and recover certain duties, taxes, or fees  upon the exportation or destruction of imported  merchandise under CBP supervision.\nFebruary 2018. The February 2018 deployment completed most core  capabilities for post-release, including reconciliation, liquidation, and  drawback\u2014functions related to the final determination and payment of  duties to CBP (see sidebar).\nCBP initially intended to implement collections in ACE along with other  post-release core capabilities. However, CBP officials told us that after a  series of unsuccessful attempts to move collections from ACS to ACE,  the agency decided in July 2017 to decouple collections from the other  remaining post-release capabilities. Agency officials explained that this  would allow deployment of other post-release capabilities by the end of  February 2018. CBP officials observed that technical challenges involved  in moving the current collections function\u2014which is needed to complete  post-release functions such as liquidation\u2014from ACS into ACE primarily  accounted for CBP\u2019s inability to finish deploying core ACE capabilities in  2017.\nCBP officials stated that the agency will continue to link the newly  deployed post-release capabilities to collections in ACS while deciding  how to proceed. According to CBP officials, the agency expects to select  one of three options for collections by the end of March 2018: (1) add a  collections capability to ACE, (2) retain collections in ACS, or (3) develop  a separate collections system. CBP officials stated that the agency would  revise its estimate of the overall cost of completing and maintaining ACE  through the system\u2019s expected life cycle after reaching this decision.\nThe timeline in figure 2 summarizes CBP\u2019s efforts to develop and deploy  core ACE capabilities since 2013.\n\n\tPartner Agencies That Clear or License Cargo Have Access to ACE, but Extent of Use Varies\n\nAll partner agencies that CBP identified as bearing responsibility for  clearing or licensing goods for import or export have been granted some  access to ACE data. However, as our case studies of five partner  agencies illustrate, the extent to which these agencies use the system  varies, and agencies are continuing efforts to enhance their use of ACE.\n\n\t\tAll Agencies with Responsibility for Clearing and Licensing Cargo Have Been Granted Access to ACE Data\n\nEach of the 22 partner agencies with responsibility for clearing or  licensing cargo has signed a memorandum of understanding with CBP  that allows access to ACE and details the information the agency will  receive through the system, according to CBP officials. Table 1 lists the  22 partner agencies CBP identified as having responsibility for clearing or  licensing cargo and as having signed a memorandum of understanding  with CBP  According to CBP, each memorandum of understanding specifies data  that the partner agency may access in accordance with its responsibilities  and as allowed by statute. Agencies may obtain these data through  ACE in the following ways:\nAgencies may specify data elements to be included in the ACE  partner government agency message set\u2014that is, the consolidated  set of data that importers and exporters submit electronically. In many  cases, the message set includes data elements formerly collected  through paper forms, according to CBP officials.\nAgencies may require submission of supporting documents (e.g.,  cargo manifests) as image files through the ACE Document Image  System.\nAgencies may access these data directly through ACE or may establish  web linkages between ACE and their own data processing systems that  will allow their systems to receive automatic transmissions of ACE data.  CBP documents show that among the 22 agencies CBP identified as  having responsibility for clearing or licensing cargo,\n16 have established web linkages between ACE and their own data\n14 obtain agency-specific data through the ACE message set, and\n17 receive document image files from importers through ACE.\nIn addition, 15 of the 22 agencies have completed, or are conducting,  pilots to initiate or expand their participation in ACE.\n\n\t\tCase Studies Show Variation in Use of ACE among Agencies That Clear or License Cargo\n\nWhile all of the 22 agencies that CBP identified as having responsibility  for clearing or licensing cargo have access to ACE data, our case studies  of 5 agencies found considerable variation in the extent to which they use  ACE for import processing. As table 2 shows, 4 of these agencies (FDA,  NHTSA, CPSC, and APHIS) have established linkages between ACE and  their own import data analysis systems, apply ACE data in those systems,  and have completed pilots to begin or expand their use of ACE. Agency  staff also may access ACE directly to obtain additional information that is  not available in their agencies\u2019 systems. Nonetheless, we found  significant differences in the agencies\u2019 use of ACE to obtain agency- specific data from importers: While FDA and NHTSA have largely  transitioned to using ACE for this purpose, CPSC and APHIS use it to a  more limited extent, and FWS continues to obtain data on imported goods  largely without using ACE. All five agencies reported ongoing efforts to  resolve difficulties related to using ACE and make greater use of the  system.\nAccording to CBP documents, several of these 27 other agencies have not concluded  an ACE memorandum of understanding with CBP and do not appear to be accessing  ACE\u2014in some cases because ACE does not generate information that serves an agency  need, according to CBP and Treasury Department officials.\n\n\t\t\tFDA Uses ACE Data to Review and Target Imports for Health Risks\n\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)  FDA applies health and safety standards to a  variety of imported products, including food,  drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, biologics,  tobacco, and radiation-emitting electronic  products. To carry out these functions, FDA  maintains a nationwide network of port-based  staff with authority to review and, if  necessary, refuse entry to goods that do not  comply with pertinent laws and regulations  that it enforces. FDA maintains two internal  information technology systems to assist  these efforts: the Operational and  Administrative System for Import Support, for  admissibility review of imports, and the  Predictive Risk Evaluation for Dynamic Import  Targeting system, a risk-based screening tool  that performs an initial electronic screening of  import entries containing FDA regulated  articles to target those items with potentially  higher public health risk for a manual  admissibility review.\nFDA has integrated its internal systems with ACE and uses ACE data to  review imports under its jurisdiction, targeting FDA-regulated imports that  pose higher public health risks for manual review to determine the  imports\u2019 admissibility, according to FDA officials. FDA has worked with  CBP to establish bilateral transmission of import entry data between CBP  and FDA since 1997, when the two agencies linked FDA\u2019s earlier import  operations system with CBP\u2019s ACS, according to FDA. Consequently,  FDA officials described the transition to ACE as an upgrade, substantially  expanding the information available to the agency, rather than a new  approach to processing imports.\nFDA officials stated that they coordinated with the trade community and  CBP to complete the transition to using ACE. For example, the officials  said that they consulted with the trade community to develop FDA\u2019s ACE  message set, with the goal of improving the clearance process. According  to FDA officials, the data that the agency required through the message  set included more information than it had previously required from  importers through ACS. FDA officials explained that their intent in adding  data elements was to facilitate the automated admissibility review of low- risk FDA-regulated articles and thus focus agency resources on articles  associated with a higher public health risk. Additionally, FDA worked with  the trade community to develop recommendations for technical  enhancements to ACE. Finally, FDA tested the new systems and the  viability of the message set in a pilot that it successfully concluded in  2016.\nAccording to agency officials, in November 2016, FDA issued a final rule  requiring that the trade community, when electronically submitting an  entry in ACE, provide certain information on all incoming cargo that is  subject to FDA regulation. In most cases, FDA finds this information  sufficient to determine admissibility. However, in about 3 percent of  cases, FDA requests additional information directly from importers, using  the agency\u2019s Import Trade Auxiliary Communications System. FDA  officials stated that the agency is pursuing improvements in its ability to  communicate with importers via ACE.\n\n\t\t\tNHTSA Uses ACE Data to Review Motor Vehicle Imports\n\nNational Highway Safety Transportation  Administration (NHTSA)  NHTSA works to ensure that imported motor  vehicles and equipment (e.g., tires) meet U.S.  safety standards. According to agency  officials, because NHTSA does not have  independent authority to hold incoming cargo  and does not have any staff at U.S. ports, it  relies on U.S. Customs and Border Protection  officials to hold and inspect cargo and to take  enforcement action if indicated (e.g., seizing  goods or denying entry) in consultation with  NHTSA. To fulfill its tasks, NHTSA uses its  Motor Vehicle Importation Information  database to assist in admissibility and  targeting decisions.\nNHTSA is using ACE data to review and clear imported motor vehicles  and equipment for entry into the U.S. market and works with CBP to  assess the compliance of certain products offered for importation. NHTSA  established an electronic link between its internal system and CBP\u2019s ACS  in 1992. At that time, NHTSA and CBP arranged for importers to submit  NHTSA\u2019s required paper form electronically through ACS. In 2015,  NHTSA began transitioning to ACE by pilot-testing submission of data for  a large ACE message set. According to NHTSA officials, the testing  process revealed significant technical problems. Prior to the pilot testing,  the trade community expressed concern about the number of data  elements that NHTSA asked CBP to collect from the trade community.  The Office of Management and Budget determined that certain proposed  requirements were burdensome for the trade community and asked  NHTSA to eliminate some of these requirements. Subsequently, in March  2016, NHTSA completed its transition to ACE with fewer data  requirements.\nIn addition to using ACE data, NHTSA continues to obtain information  directly from importers, when necessary, through its Motor Vehicle  Importation Information system. For example, according to NHTSA  officials, the agency requests information through its system when it  identifies reporting errors in ACE or when additional information is needed  for certain temporary imports, such as vehicles or equipment imported for  research or demonstration purposes. NHTSA officials stated that they are  working with CBP to overcome a major challenge to efficient  collaboration: NHTSA uses vehicle identification numbers to track  imported vehicles, while ACE does not. According to NHTSA officials,  NHTSA has developed a database to provide public access to  manufacturer identification and vehicle identification number-deciphering  information submitted by manufacturers. According to NHTSA, CBP port  staff have begun accessing the database but it has not yet been linked to  ACE.\n\n\t\t\tCPSC Uses ACE Data to Target Imported Consumer Products\n\nConsumer Product Safety Commission  (CPSC)  CPSC protects the public from unreasonable  risk of injury or death associated with  consumer products, including over two-thirds  of all categories of imported goods, such as  toys, children\u2019s sleepwear, and household  electronics. CPSC expanded examination of.  imported goods in 2008 following passage of  the Consumer Product Safety Improvement  Act of 2008, which required the agency to  develop a risk-assessment methodology for  certain imports. CPSC maintains a limited  presence at U.S. ports and has independent  authority to hold incoming cargo for  inspection. The agency employs its Risk  Assessment Methodology targeting system to  assist in its import oversight responsibilities  by generating potential targets for inspection.\nCPSC uses only ACE data collected under CBP authority to support its  oversight of consumer product imports and is considering expanding the  information it receives from ACE. CPSC\u2019s internal Risk Assessment  Methodology targeting system focuses on 300 high-risk categories of  imports listed by CPSC, using U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes,  and currently receives the standard data that CBP obtains via ACE on all  imported goods under the agency\u2019s jurisdiction, according to CPSC  officials. After launching an initial pilot version of its system in 2011,  CPSC initiated discussion with the trade community in 2014 about  expanding its electronic data reporting requirements to add certain data  elements to the ACE message set that would assist the agency in  determining whether incoming products meet applicable standards.  However, CPSC reduced the scope of the proposed expansion of  reporting requirements after trade community representatives expressed  concerns. In 2016, CPSC concluded an initial, limited pilot test of  electronic filing of several additional data elements. According to CPSC  officials, the agency plans to study the benefits of adding these elements  before it initiates a second pilot and has not reached a final decision  about requiring importers to submit any additional information through  ACE.\nCPSC staff continue to rely primarily on the agency\u2019s internal targeting  system to target incoming shipments for review and possible inspection,  with contributions from CPSC staff at CBP\u2019s Commercial Targeting and  Analysis Center and at ports, according to CPSC officials. These officials  stated that the agency\u2019s representative at the Commercial Targeting and  Analysis Center employs CBP and CPSC resources to generate about 30  percent of the targeting orders disseminated to CPSC staff at ports.  Agency staff at two New York ports told us that ACE can be a useful  source of additional information for their local targeting efforts.\n\n\t\t\tAPHIS Makes Limited Use of ACE Data to Review Imports for Agricultural Risks\n\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection  Service (APHIS)  APHIS collaborates with Customs and Border  Protection agricultural specialists to keep  agricultural pests and diseases out of the  United States. In pursuit of this mission, the  agency maintains Plant Protection and  Quarantine and Veterinary Services units at  some ports of entry and operates its own data  analysis system, the Agriculture Risk  Management system. APHIS also implements  a requirement to file a plant and plant produce  import declaration on arrival in the United  States, as mandated under the 2008 Lacey  Act. Importers may file the declaration in ACE  or in APHIS\u2019s Lacey Act Web Governance  System.\nAPHIS\u2019s use of ACE data remains limited while the agency works to  expand linkages between its data processing systems and ACE.  According to APHIS officials, the agency did not establish an electronic  link to ACS, ACE\u2019s precursor system, and instead used paper forms in its  import review processes. In 2016, the agency pilot-tested electronic  submission of APHIS-specific partner agency message set data through  ACE and subsequently announced that data could be submitted through  ACE for APHIS compliance review. However, trade community  participation remains voluntary except for Lacey Act\u2013covered imports.  According to APHIS officials, companies that import APHIS-regulated  products have been slow to invest the resources required to transition to  reporting through ACE and, as a result, use paper forms to submit  information about most shipments of such products. However, APHIS  officials observed that reporting through ACE occurs for a small but  growing share of all imports subject to APHIS regulation.\nAPHIS has been collaborating with CBP to provide for the effective flow of  information between ACE and APHIS\u2019s systems, but these efforts remain  incomplete. While staff of APHIS\u2019s Veterinary Services unit may access  ACE data directly to complete their import review processes, APHIS  intends for its Plant Protection and Quarantine staff to access ACE data  through the agency\u2019s Agriculture Risk Management system, according to  APHIS officials. However, these officials informed us that the functionality  required for accessing ACE data through that system is still under  development. They explained that Plant Protection and Quarantine staff  will use ACE to receive and reply to inquiries from, and provide  assistance to, CBP agricultural specialists regarding incoming cargo  requiring inspection and that significant coordination is required to fully  integrate the two agencies\u2019 data processing systems.\nAPHIS officials observed that a CBP requirement for partner agencies to  complete extensive background checks of staff before they can receive  access to ACE has presented another obstacle to greater use of the  system by staff of both Plant Protection and Quarantine and Veterinary  Services. In November 2017, APHIS officials informed us that more  than 100 agency staff had completed these background checks and thus  had access to ACE but that the current number of users remained  insufficient to process many APHIS-regulated goods in ACE.\n\n\t\t\tFish and Wildlife Service Makes Little Use of ACE Data\n\nFish and Wildlife Service (FWS)  FWS monitors wildlife trade and works to  prevent the illegal importation or exportation  of species (including parts and products  thereof) that are regulated under the  Convention on International Trade in  Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora  and U.S. wildlife laws and regulations,  according to  U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP). Virtually all wildlife imports  and exports must be declared to FWS and  cleared by FWS wildlife officers, according to  CBP. To carry out its responsibilities, FWS  maintains staff at 38 U.S. ports and generally  requires that all internationally traded wildlife  and wildlife products be routed through  designated ports. FWS staff are able to place  holds on, to inspect, and to deny entry or exit  to incoming or outgoing cargo, according to  agency officials. FWS staff obtain information  about incoming or outgoing cargo from data  filed by the trade community in the agency\u2019s  own data analysis and targeting system, the  Law Enforcement Management Information  System.\nFWS use of ACE data in its import review and regulation activities has  been minimal, in part because of technical challenges. According to FWS  officials, the agency attempted during the 1990s to integrate its activities  with ACS. After concluding that ACS did not meet FWS needs, the  agency discontinued these efforts in 2000 and developed its own  Electronic Declarations system for the trade community to submit data to  the agency\u2019s data analysis and targeting system. Agency officials told us  that FWS port staff may access ACE and that some find it a useful source  of additional information on incoming cargo. However, FWS has not yet  integrated ACE into FWS operations.\nFWS officials told us that lack of alignment between the Harmonized  Tariff Schedule codes that CBP uses to organize its work and FWS\u2019s  regulatory responsibilities constitutes a significant challenge in integrating  ACE into FWS operations. For example, the tariff schedule may indicate  only that an import is leather footwear, while FWS operations may also  require additional information about the leather\u2019s source, such as the type  of animal, its nation of origin, and its domestication status. According to  FWS and CBP officials, FWS has so far been unable to overcome this  difficulty.\nAccording to FWS officials, the agency pilot-tested participation in ACE  during 2016 but suspended the test in January 2017 in light of trade  community concerns about expanded reporting requirements, lack of  clarity in the requirements, and uncertainty regarding FWS\u2019s authority to collect data electronically. According to FWS officials, the agency  subsequently began efforts to reach agreement with trade community  representatives and CBP on an approach to data collection through ACE  that will meet the needs of both FWS and the trade community. FWS  officials stated in November 2017 that these discussions had produced an  interim solution and were continuing and that FWS and CBP planned to  resume pilot testing in March or April 2018.\n\n\tACE Users Report Cost Savings and Enforcement Benefits\n\nCBP and partner agency officials and trade community representatives  told us that their use of ACE has reduced costs by increasing the  efficiency of trade processing. CBP and partner agency officials also  reported that the system has strengthened their ability to enforce trade  laws and regulations. CBP has developed metrics for itself and the trade  community that estimate savings associated with the increased efficiency  of some processes in ACE. According to CBP documents and officials,  the agency plans to expand its metrics for capturing ACE benefits\u2014for  example, to estimate the value of increased efficiencies for partner  agencies and to measure any savings associated with the remaining core  ACE capabilities after they are implemented.\n\n\t\tACE Users Report the System Has Improved Efficiency, Reduced Costs, and Enhanced Enforcement\n\n\t\t\tAgencies and Trade Community Report Improved Efficiency and Associated Savings\n\nCBP, partner agencies, and trade community representatives who use  ACE to conduct their work told us that the use of ACE had improved the  efficiency of import processing and brought associated cost savings.\nFewer paper records. According to CBP officials at the Port of New  York, the use of ACE for electronic data submission has significantly  reduced reliance on paper forms in processing imports. The officials  noted that before ACE was implemented, their reception area was  typically filled with couriers delivering large volumes of paper for  manual processing. CBP officials told us that electronic data  submission through ACE had allowed CBP and partner agencies to  automate over 250 paper forms. In addition, one trade community  representative we spoke with said that elimination of paper records  had been the primary benefit realized through ACE implementation.\nCBP has estimated, on the basis of an informal poll survey of private  companies, that eliminating document delivery to CBP offices would  save $25 per courier trip.\nFaster processing. According to CBP and partner agency officials,  ACE\u2019s automated review of data submitted by importing companies  speeds the agencies\u2019 processing and clearing of eligible shipments for  release. CBP officials at the Port of New York commented that  although reviewing and clearing incoming cargo for release through  ACS required approximately 24 hours, performing this process  through ACE takes only a few minutes if data are complete and  properly formatted and if the cargo does not require inspection. For  example, CBP officials stated that the Environmental Protection  Agency formerly took an average of about 4 days to clear cargo for  release into the U.S. market but now takes only seconds to clear  nonproblematic shipments. CBP officials further observed that the  reduction in document processing and the elimination of manual data  review for nonproblematic imports increases the time available for  CBP officials at ports to engage in tasks such as examining cargo that  may violate U.S. trade and customs laws. In addition, NHTSA officials  stated that ACE had substantially speeded their review and clearance  process. Further, FDA reported that since the agency\u2019s cargo review  and clearance process had been linked to ACE, the portion of  incoming FDA-regulated cargo receiving an automated \u201cmay proceed\u201d  had increased from 26 to 62 percent and processing time for these  entries averaged less than 2 minutes. According to trade community  representatives and CBP officials, ACE has also dramatically reduced  the time required to file bond applications, from several days to a few  seconds.\nReduced labor and storage costs. CBP officials and trade  community representatives reported that efficiency improvements  resulting from the use of ACE can lead to substantial labor- and  storage-cost savings for the trade community. CBP officials observed  that expedited processing can reduce storage and demurrage costs  for importers. For example, CBP officials commented that  companies in the Newark, N.J., area could be charged $250 to $300  per day to store a container awaiting clearance to enter the U.S.  market.\nFewer supply chain disruptions. CBP and trade community  representatives reported that ACE had reduced the negative impacts  that import processing delays can have on company supply chains.  For example, a pharmaceutical company representative stated that  ACE had reduced delays in processing incoming cargo that, before  ACE was implemented, sometimes lasted for 10 days or longer,  resulting in costly supply chain failures. According to this  representative, a longer-than-expected delay of an imported material  that is a vital ingredient in a time-sensitive clinical trial or a treatment  could result in significant material losses.\n\n\t\t\tCBP and Partner Agencies Report ACE Has Improved Enforcement\n\nWhile ACE is not a targeting system, the data that ACE provides has  improved CBP\u2019s and partner agencies\u2019 ability to identify and examine  incoming cargo for inspection, according to CBP and partner agency  officials. For example, ACE, in addition to other sources, provides data  that CBP uses in its Automated Targeting System and that most of the  partner agencies we examined use in their data analysis and targeting  systems to flag relatively high-risk cargo for possible inspection by port  officials. (See text box for examples of CBP\u2019s and partner agencies\u2019  targeting efforts.)\nExamples of CBP and Partner Agency Efforts to Target High-Risk Imports U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and its partner agencies perform targeting of  imports at the national and local levels. For example:\nCBP. At the national level, CBP maintains the Automated Targeting System, which  compares traveler, cargo, and conveyance information against law enforcement,  intelligence, and other enforcement data, using risk-based targeting scenarios and  assessments to identify relatively high-risk cargo. CBP also operates the Commercial  Targeting and Analysis Center, which facilitates targeting and enforcement  information sharing among partner agencies involved in clearing or licensing cargo. In  addition, CBP maintains five National Targeting and Analysis Groups, each targeting  higher-risk imports related to one of the CBP\u2019s priority trade issues. For instance, the  National Targeting and Analysis Group for Trade Agreements targets shipments for  which the country of origin has been misrepresented to avoid import duties. CBP  officials at ports of entry also conduct locally focused targeting efforts.\nPartner agencies. All five of the partner agencies we selected for our review\u2014the  Food and Drug Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,  the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2014work with CBP in the Commercial  Targeting and Analysis Center while also employing their own import data analysis  and targeting systems. In addition, agencies with personnel at U.S. ports of entry may  conduct locally focused targeting efforts.\nCBP officials indicated that ACE had improved their trade enforcement  efforts. For example:\nCBP officials stated that ACE\u2019s streamlining of import processing  helps to better ensure compliance with trade laws and regulations.  CBP port staff stated that reduction in the time required to process  paper forms has allowed them to devote more time to higher value- added activities such as inspecting incoming cargo. In addition, CBP  officials at the Commercial Targeting and Analysis Center said that it  was easier to access and generate reports in ACE than in ACS.\nCBP officials observed that ACE\u2019s collection of additional information  facilitates trade enforcement. Officials in the agency\u2019s National  Targeting and Analysis Groups explained that ACE functions as a  valuable system of record that can be employed to refine and focus  targeting efforts, as the results of each examination undertaken are  recorded in ACE for future reference. Similarly, CBP officers in the  New York area said that ACE was a valuable source of additional  information\u2014for example, data on particular products or importing  companies\u2014that helped them in their local targeting efforts.\nIn addition, partner agency officials at ports indicated that ACE data were  indirectly or directly useful in their enforcement efforts. For example, FDA  officials in the New York area told us that, while they do not access ACE  directly, FDA\u2019s targeting system, on which they primarily rely, does  access ACE data. FDA headquarters officials noted that ACE provides  the agency\u2019s targeting system with more data elements than it received  through ACS and that this has led to greater processing efficiency. A  CPSC port official stated that he found ACE a very useful source of  information that helped him to refine his local targeting efforts.\nCBP expects the use of ACE to also yield indirect, economy-wide benefits  by improving the targeting of shipments that violate U.S. trade policy,  according to a CBP official and a CBP analysis. For example, according  to a CBP official we interviewed, more-thorough enforcement of U.S. anti- dumping and countervailing duty orders would reduce the entry of  products that unfairly compete with U.S. producers. Similarly, a cost- benefit analysis that CBP conducted in 2002 cited reduced predatory or  unfair trade practices as a potential benefit of ACE. In addition, the CBP  official observed that the use of ACE for targeting shipments could help to  prevent injuries to American consumers by reducing the number of  unsafe foreign products that enter the U.S. market.\n\n\t\tCBP Has Developed, and Plans to Expand, Metrics to Estimate the Value of Process Efficiencies Gained through ACE\n\n\t\t\tCBP Has Developed Some Metrics to Value Efficiency Gains for Itself and the Trade Community\n\nCBP has developed metrics to estimate the value of efficiency gains  associated with the use of some of the implemented ACE capabilities for  itself and the trade community. CBP\u2019s metrics capture reductions in the  time required for CBP staff to complete certain import processes now  included in ACE and translate these efficiency gains into dollar values.  CBP performs similar calculations for the trade community, using survey  data from companies on the savings they estimate are realized when  import processes are transitioned into ACE. For fiscal year 2017, CBP  estimated that efficiencies gained through the implemented core ACE  capabilities for which it had developed metrics had a total value of nearly  $28 million for itself and about $52 million for the trade community. These  metrics estimate potential cost savings associated with efficiency gains  resulting from the use of ACE, according to CBP officials; the estimates  do not account for CBP\u2019s costs for developing and maintaining ACE,  which, according to CBP, amounted to about $118 million in fiscal year  2017. In addition, the estimates do not account for costs that the trade  community has sustained in adapting to ACE. For example, one  representative of a large company estimated that the total cost of  developing appropriate software had exceeded $12 million.\nCBP\u2019s metrics capture increased efficiency gains in a number of areas.  For example, ACE includes a feature that allows members of the trade  community to submit corrections to data on incoming shipments after the  data have been summarized and presented to, and accepted by, CBP.\nImporters formerly requested such \u201cpost summary corrections\u201d by  submitting a paper form for CBP\u2019s review. To capture the value of this  procedural change for CBP, the agency surveys CBP officials to  determine their time savings on each post summary correction and  multiplies the average per-transaction time saved by the number of  summaries submitted and the CBP officials\u2019 average hourly compensation  rate. To capture the value of the change for members of the trade  community, CBP surveys importers, brokers, and shippers to determine  their average savings for each transaction and multiplies the reported  savings by the number of summaries submitted. CBP\u2019s metrics also  capture reductions in the time that CBP officers devote to completing  primary processing for incoming cargo, the time that trucks must spend  waiting at border crossings for clearance to enter the United States, and  the time that CBP and members of the trade community devote to  processing applications for customs bonds, among other things.\nCBP\u2019s estimate of the value of efficiencies resulting from the use of ACE  has grown over time. For example, for fiscal year 2014, CBP estimated  the total value of these efficiencies for CBP and the trade community at  about $33 million\u2014about 40 percent of the total value of such efficiencies  CBP reported for fiscal year 2017. This increase reflects CBP\u2019s progress  in deploying core capabilities and in developing and applying metrics to  capture the capabilities\u2019 value to CBP and the trade community. The  increase in the estimated value also reflects growing use of ACE by  partner agencies and members of the trade community. For example, the  number of import entry summaries that partner agencies filed in ACE  increased fourfold in the 3-year period from January 2014 through  January 2017.\nAccording to CBP officials, CBP and partner agencies are unable to  develop metrics to quantify trade enforcement benefits that may have  resulted from their use of ACE, in part because of a lack of baseline  information and the difficulty of isolating such impacts. For example, an  increase in seizures may reflect increased efforts, increased efficiency in  those efforts, or an increase in the volume of imports subject to seizure.  Similarly, according to a CBP official, a lack of baseline information  makes it difficult to assess any broader impacts of improved trade  enforcement resulting from the use of ACE, such as prevention of injuries  to American consumers through better targeting of harmful foreign  products.\n\n\t\t\tCBP Plans to Expand Its Metrics for Savings and Other Benefits\n\nCBP reported that it is working to expand its metrics for estimating cost  savings associated with improved trade processing efficiencies and other  benefits resulting from the use of ACE.\nCBP officials stated that they expect to have collected sufficient data  in the near future to begin reporting on the estimated dollar value of  efficiencies that partner agencies are realizing through ACE. While  CBP measures efficiency improvements and associated savings  resulting from CBP and the trade community\u2019s use of ACE, CBP and  most partner agencies currently do not collect or report information  about efficiency improvements or associated savings that the partner  agencies may have realized.\nCBP has prepared baseline information that will allow it to measure  efficiency improvements and estimate any savings associated with  several post-release core ACE capabilities, including reconciliation,  liquidation, and drawback, after they are implemented. For example,  on the basis of an internal study completed in late 2016, CBP has  determined that agency officials take about 1.8 hours, on average, to  process a drawback entry summary. Comparing this average time  with the average time required after this post-release capability is  implemented in ACE will allow CBP to calculate the average time  saved per transaction. CBP plans to obtain comparable information  from the trade community to allow similar calculations of efficiency  improvements for importing companies.\nCBP officials stated that, while the agency does not currently measure  any improvement in revenue collection that may have resulted from  the implemented capabilities, CBP plans to undertake efforts to better  understand the current revenue collection environment and to explore  ways to collect baseline information on revenue collections. The  officials said that CBP intends to identify revenue collection metrics  that are quantifiable and reportable after it deploys the liquidation and  reconciliation capabilities in ACE and completes deployment of  collections.\nAccording to CBP documents, CBP\u2019s Office of Trade has outlined a  strategy for improving the agency\u2019s ability to measure benefits  resulting from the use of ACE. CBP documents indicate that this  strategy will include efforts to measure, to the extent that data are  available, the impact of any enhancements to the system after  implementation of core capabilities is complete, including  enhancements identified as critical components in improving import or  export operations.\n\n\tApproach to Managing ACE after Implementation of Core Capabilities Has Not Been Established\n\nCBP does not have a process in place to manage the continued  development of ACE after February 2018, when it finished implementing  most of the capabilities it identified as core. ACE users in CBP, partner  agencies, and the trade community have identified a number of  shortcomings in ACE and have suggested enhancements to address  them. CBP has identified a small number of enhancements suggested by  CBP and the trade community as near-term priorities and identified a  number of others to consider for priority status. However, a substantial  number of additional suggested enhancements, including submissions  from partner agencies, remain unaddressed. Further, a process for  prioritizing all suggested enhancements has not been established.  Moreover, funding for the continued development of ACE after fiscal year  2018\u2014including funding to address most of the suggested  enhancements\u2014has not been identified. CBP and its partner agencies  are working to establish a management approach that includes processes  for prioritizing and funding enhancements from all sources, but it is  unclear when these discussions will conclude or the extent to which they  will resolve outstanding issues. Federal guidance calls for establishing the  organizational structure necessary to achieve objectives, including  compatible means of operating across agency boundaries.\n\n\t\tACE Users Have Identified Shortcomings in ACE and Suggested Enhancements to Address Them\n\nACE users in CBP, the trade community, and partner agencies have  identified a variety of shortcomings in ACE and have suggested  enhancements to address them. Examples of reported shortcomings  include the following:\nCBP officials tasked with validating data in ACE to assess compliance  with trade laws and with processing importers\u2019 protests of duty  assessments told us that performing those tasks in ACE is labor  intensive and cumbersome.\nCBP and agency officials noted that ACE has not yet been updated to  respond to a number of legal requirements, including several TFTEA  provisions and agency regulations necessitating certain  enhancements to ACE.\nSome partner agency officials cited capabilities that were included in  ACS but, despite being needed by the agencies for their import review  and enforcement responsibilities, had not been deployed in ACE.\nCBP agriculture specialists identified a number of shortcomings in  ACE capabilities for processing imported agricultural goods. ACE  contains a \u201cworkspace\u201d specifically designed for agricultural goods,  but it is incomplete.\nTrade community officials highlighted the need for a variety of  improvements in the arrival/cargo-release and post-release phases of  the import process, such as improving the ability of agency officials  and the trade community to send messages in ACE and increasing  the size of files that the trade community can submit.\nA 2016 CBP survey of ACE users, including trade community  representatives and partner agency officials, found that while the  majority of respondents were satisfied with the ease of using ACE,  substantial minorities (29 percent of CBP respondents, 36 percent of  partner agency respondents, and 31 percent of trade community  respondents) were dissatisfied, citing concern with navigation and  functional limitations.\nIn response to such shortcomings, ACE users have submitted a large  number of suggestions for enhancements to ACE. According to a CBP  document, as of July 2017, 671 enhancements had been submitted since  the early 2000s and many of these had been addressed; however, a  third of those submitted (223) remained to be addressed. Of the  unaddressed enhancements, nearly three-quarters were submitted by  trade community representatives (see fig. 3). According to CBP officials,  funding constraints, as well as the effort required to complete deployment  of core ACE capabilities within established time frames, largely precluded  efforts to address enhancements over the last year. CBP officials stated  that, because ACE is not funded to support enhancements, funding for  enhancements suggested by CBP or the trade community must be  provided by a CBP unit and funding for enhancements suggested by a  partner agency must be provided by that agency.\nWhile postponing action on these suggestions, as of November 2017  CBP had prioritized seven enhancements suggested by CBP staff or the  trade community to be implemented in the near term, most of them in  response to legal or technical requirements. CBP also had identified 22  additional enhancements suggested by CBP staff or the trade community  for consideration as priorities.\nPrioritized enhancements. CBP\u2019s seven prioritized ACE enhancements  include two that had been scheduled for implementation in fiscal year  2017 and five that were scheduled for implementation as post-core  activities begin. According to CBP officials, the agency prioritized three  of the seven enhancements in response to provisions in TFTEA; one of  these three, pertaining to drawback processes, was necessitated by  changes in the act, and the other two were intended to support changes  in CBP procedure mandated by the act, according to CBP officials (see  table 3). The CBP officials said that a fourth enhancement was required  to comply with a new electronic filing rule by the U.S. Court of  International Trade and that a fifth was needed to correct technical  obsolescence. As table 3 shows, the information that CBP officials  provided identified in general terms the enforcement or other benefits that  could be realized through addressing these prioritized enhancements. As  the table shows, as of September 2017, CBP had identified funding for  three of these seven priorities.\nAccepted but unprioritized enhancements. CBP officials also provided  us with a list of 22 unprioritized enhancements suggested by CBP staff  and the trade community that had been presented to CBP\u2019s Product  Management Committee for assessment and possible prioritization.  Several of these enhancements are aimed at strengthening ACE  provisions for processing agricultural imports. For example, one  enhancement would improve the interface between ACE and various  Department of Agriculture subsystems, reducing the need to manually  enter data in multiple systems. Another enhancement would integrate the  ACE agricultural workspace and CBP\u2019s Automated Targeting System,  strengthening targeting for agricultural imports. The list of unprioritized  enhancements also includes initiatives to simplify several import  processing steps for the trade community, allowing faster processing and  associated cost savings.\n\n\t\tProcess for Prioritizing Enhancements from All Sources Has Not Been Established\n\nWhile CBP has a process for prioritizing enhancements suggested by its  own staff or by members of the trade community (see text box), no  process has been established for prioritizing enhancements suggested by  partner agencies or for making priority decisions among all suggested  enhancements, including those submitted by partner agencies.  Enhancements suggested by partner agencies are provided to the Border  Interagency Executive Council (BIEC) for prioritization. The BIEC, which  CBP chairs, was created to improve coordination among ITDS partner  agencies. The BIEC\u2019s responsibilities extend to reviewing and prioritizing  partner agency suggestions for enhancing ACE, according to CBP  officials. However, CBP officials told us in September 2017 that the BIEC  did not have explicit criteria for prioritizing partner agency suggestions  and had not yet agreed on a cost-sharing strategy that would allow  multiple agencies to share the cost of enhancements that might benefit  those agencies. In the absence of such a process, CBP has been  evaluating partner agency\u2013suggested enhancements on a first-come,  first-served basis, and partner agencies requesting such enhancements  are required to pay for them on a fee-for-service basis, according to CBP  officials.\nCBP\u2019s Documented Process for Prioritizing ACE Enhancements Suggested by CBP  Staff or the Trade Community\nCBP policy offices consider six criteria to decide whether to accept or reject  enhancements suggested by CBP and the trade community: (1) completion of  technical requirements to assess the required level of effort; (2) legal and regulatory  provisions; (3) overlap with, or connection to, other enhancements in development or  already deployed; (4) availability of funding and contract vehicles; (5) possible  burden on trade, especially on existing coding or business processes; and (6)  possible burden on CBP. CBP adds accepted enhancements to a list of  \u201cunprioritized initiatives.\u201d\nCBP\u2019s Product Management Committee considers four criteria in assessing  unprioritized initiatives for placement on the agency\u2019s \u201cshort list\u201d of priorities: (1) the  enhancement aligns with a CBP mission priority, (2) the enhancement meets a  legislative or regulatory requirement, (3) the enhancement is associated with a  security protocol or gap, and (4) funding for the enhancement is available. According  to CBP officials, an affirmative response to one or more of these criteria yields a  higher probability that the enhancement will be deemed a priority.  To prepare enhancements for development and deployment, CBP estimates the  level of effort required, gathers high-level requirements, and conducts impact  assessments. Once planning is complete, the CBP policy office sponsoring the  priority develops a business case for initiatives on the \u201cshort list\u201d of priorities,  including budget justification and information on potential benefits/return on  investment.\n\n\t\tFunding for ACE Development after Fiscal Year 2018 Has Not Been Identified\n\nAlthough CBP identified funding to complete the implementation of core  ACE capabilities as defined by CBP in fiscal year 2018, officials of CBP  and its partner agencies stated that they have not identified funding for  the continued development of ACE, including most of the enhancements  that have been suggested by CBP, the trade community, or partner  agencies. Through fiscal year 2017, CBP maintained separate accounts  to support ACE operations and maintenance and ACE acquisitions\u2014that  is, development and deployment of new ACE capabilities. According to  CBP officials, the agency\u2019s ACE acquisition funds were used exclusively  to develop and deploy ACE capabilities that the agency defined as core.  Neither acquisition funds nor operations and maintenance funds were  available for enhancements to the core system, according to the officials.\nHowever, CBP officials told us in November 2017 that, beginning in fiscal  year 2018, the agency\u2019s planned annual budgets for ACE would include  funds only for operations and maintenance and would no longer include  funds to support acquisitions. CBP officials stated that the agency had  identified additional funding to complete core ACE capabilities, other than  collections, in fiscal year 2018 and to ensure that these capabilities  operate in concert with ACS, which the agency uses for collections.  However, the agency had not yet identified funding for several  enhancements that CBP considered near-term priorities (see table 3) or  for the longer list of accepted but unprioritized enhancements suggested  by CBP staff or the trade community. CBP officials estimated that  supporting post-core development will require about $7 million in  additional funds in fiscal year 2019 and slightly more than $14 million  annually in additional funds in the succeeding 3 years. Figure 4  summarizes CBP\u2019s anticipated ACE funding requirements for fiscal years  2019 through 2022, as identified by CBP in November 2016 and  September 2017.\n\n\t\tApproach to Managing ACE after Completion of Core Capabilities Has Not Been Finalized\n\nCBP is working with its partner agencies in the BIEC to reach agreement  on an approach to managing ACE\u2019s continued development after  completing the implementation of core capabilities, but this approach has  not been finalized. According to CBP officials and some partner agency  officials, the BIEC is seeking agreement on processes for prioritizing all  suggested enhancements and for sharing the costs of maintaining and  enhancing the system.\nProcess for prioritizing enhancements. According to CBP officials,  the BIEC is developing a process for prioritizing enhancements,  including criteria to be applied and a governance process to guide  decision making. CBP officials stated that this process would be  applied to all suggested enhancements, regardless of their source.\nProcess for sharing costs. According to CBP officials, the BIEC  agreed in early 2016 to begin working toward consensus among CBP  and its partner agencies on an approach to sharing future ACE  operations and maintenance and development costs. This consensus  is to include an agreement on criteria for classifying suggested  enhancements as operations and maintenance or as new capabilities  and on funding arrangements for both categories. Additionally, the  Office of Management and Budget requested the Department of  Homeland Security and CBP to develop a cost-sharing framework,  according to CBP.\nHowever, the BIEC has not yet finalized a management approach to  address these tasks. According to CBP, in early December 2017 the  BIEC produced a document, titled \u201cBIEC Principals Single Window  Sustainment Decision Memorandum,\u201d proposing a \u201csustainment model\u201d  for ACE and received partner agency comments on this document later  that month. CBP did not provide us with copies of the memorandum or  the partner agencies\u2019 comments but stated that the comments covered  the following areas: acceptance of a proposed definition of operations and  maintenance and a \u201cpay as you go\u201d funding model, evaluation criteria for  prioritizing suggested enhancements, and an overall process for making  prioritization decisions. According to CBP officials, a draft cost-sharing  and prioritization process plan was distributed to the BIEC principals and  discussed in detail at a principals meeting on January 30, 2018, and work  on refining and finalizing this plan is continuing. CBP officials estimated  that this process would be completed by October 31, 2018.\nIn light of funding constraints and the need for broad interagency  agreement to adopt processes such as those reportedly under discussion  in the BIEC, it is unclear whether these discussions will conclude within  the specified time frame or whether the sustainment model will resolve all  outstanding issues in a manner satisfactory to participating agencies. For  example, according to FDA and Treasury officials, some partner agencies  maintain that certain improvements to ACE suggested by partner  agencies should be regarded as part of the core system\u2014traditionally  supported by CBP acquisition funds\u2014rather than treated as  enhancements that must be supported by the agencies that suggest  them. It remains unclear how such enhancements will be categorized or  funded, since CBP has indicated that it will no longer allocate funds to  ACE acquisition and that operations and maintenance funds have  traditionally not been used for such purposes.\nThe solutions to these unresolved issues will affect both CBP and its  partner agencies, according to agency officials. FDA officials observed  that CBP will not fund or implement additional capabilities without funding  for these efforts, whether through its own budget or from partner  agencies. Treasury officials observed that interagency coordination and  transfers of funding are cumbersome, costly processes. FDA officials also  commented that, rather than try to arrange cost sharing with other  agencies that may have funding constraints, partner agencies might  develop alternative systems to compensate for capabilities lacking in  ACE. FDA officials observed that this could result in multiple agencies\u2019  developing separate systems to meet similar needs.\nAccording to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  management should establish an appropriate organizational structure and  communicate effectively to achieve agency objectives. In addition, key  practices to enhance and sustain interagency collaboration include  articulating a common outcome, establishing mutually reinforcing or joint  strategies, and establishing compatible means of operating across  agency boundaries. Until CBP, in collaboration with partner agencies,  finalizes its management approach to ACE, including processes for  prioritizing, and sharing costs for, critical enhancements, U.S. agencies  and the trade community will not realize the system\u2019s full potential  benefits.\n\n\tConclusions\n\nThe need for an international trade data system to enhance U.S.  agencies\u2019 efficiency and effectiveness in processing cargo and enforcing  U.S. trade laws has long been clear. Indeed, information available from  CBP, partner agencies, and the trade community points to savings and  enforcement benefits resulting from the implemented core ACE  capabilities, including faster import processing; improved targeting; and  other benefits to partner agencies, the trade community, and consumers.  However, realization of the full benefits of transitioning to ACE continues  to be hampered by a variety of functional shortcomings\u2019.\nCBP and its partner agencies recognize the need to agree on an  approach to maintaining and continuing to develop the system after core  ACE is completed. While CBP recently completed deployment of most of  the capabilities that it identified as core, CBP and its partner agencies in  the BIEC have not yet agreed on processes for prioritizing  enhancements\u2014including those that ACE users have suggested to  improve the system\u2014and for sharing the costs of operating and  enhancing the system. Until CBP, in collaboration with its partner  agencies, finalizes an approach to post-core management of ACE that  includes such processes, as well as time frames for implementing them,  CBP, its partner agencies, and the trade community will not realize the full  potential benefits of the substantial investment ACE represents.\n\n\tRecommendation for Executive Action\n\nWe are making the following recommendation to DHS:  The Secretary of Homeland Security should ensure that the  Commissioner of CBP, in collaboration with partner agencies, finalizes an  interagency approach to the post-core management of ACE that includes  (1) processes for prioritizing enhancements to ACE and for sharing ACE  operations and maintenance and development costs, including the costs  of suggested enhancements among partner agencies that may benefit,  and (2) time frames for implementing such processes. (Recommendation  1)\n\n\tAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\n\nWe provided a draft of this report to DHS; the Departments of Agriculture,  Health and Human Services, the Interior, the Treasury, and  Transportation; and CPSC. DHS provided substantive comments, which  are reproduced in appendix III. In addition, DHS; the Departments of  Health and Human Services, the Interior, Transportation, and the  Treasury; and CPSC provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate. The Department of Agriculture did not  provide comments.\nIn its substantive comments, DHS concurred with our recommendation.  DHS also reported that some steps toward developing an interagency  approach to post-core management of ACE had been taken after we  distributed our draft report for agency comment. DHS estimated that the  process would be completed by the end of October 2018. We updated  our report accordingly.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Commissioner of CBP, the Secretaries of the  Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, the Interior, the  Treasury, and Transportation. In addition, the report is available at no  charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-8612 or gianopoulosk.gao.gov. Contact points for our  Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on  the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this  report are listed in appendix IX.\n\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\n\nIn this report, we examine (1) the status of U.S. Customs and Border  Protection\u2019s (CBP) efforts to implement core Automated Commercial  Environment (ACE) capabilities since 2013, (2) CBP partner agencies\u2019  access to ACE and use of the system for import processing, (3) available  information about any cost savings and trade enforcement benefits that  have resulted from using ACE, and (4) the approach that will be used to  manage ACE after core capabilities have been completed.\nTo examine CBP\u2019s efforts to implement ACE since 2013, we obtained  information from CBP\u2019s Office of Information Technology and Office of  Trade, which have been responsible for developing and administering  ACE. CBP documents reviewed include ACE deployment schedules,  acquisition decision memos, remediation plans, cost estimates, and a  staff post mortem report on the ACE acquisition process. We also  interviewed officials from CBP and five partner agencies regarding the  ACE acquisition process since 2013: the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of  Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),  the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and  the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). We  selected these five agencies on the basis of their size (to include both  large and small agencies), the degree to which they require  documentation for clearing or licensing cargo, and recommendations from  officials of CBP and the Department of the Treasury regarding agencies  that would provide a range of experience in transitioning to ACE. We also  reviewed prior GAO reports on ACE acquisition. While ACE is designed  to permit management of both exports and imports, we focused on the  implementation of ACE capabilities to manage imports, because CBP\u2019s  efforts to complete and improve ACE functionality are currently focused  primarily on import trade.\nTo examine other agencies\u2019 progress in accessing and using ACE data,  we obtained summary information on ACE usage for CBP\u2019s 49 partner  agencies, including information such as whether an agency had a  memorandum of understanding with CBP regarding ACE access, whether  it accessed trade data through ACE data and how it did so. While we  collected information on all 49 partner agencies, we focused our analysis on the 22 partner agencies that CBP identified as requiring  documentation for clearing or licensing cargo for import or export. To  collect this information, we identified and reviewed Federal Register  notices posted by the agencies. We obtained documentation on agency  participation in ACE from CBP officials and from the Department of the  Treasury. We also discussed the documentation and our descriptions  with CBP officials and partner agency officials. To understand how the  five selected agencies used ACE, we conducted case studies that  included reviewing CBP user guidance documents and documents from  the respective agencies on their transitions and interviewing agency  officials in Washington, D.C., and at the ports of New York and Newark.\nTo examine available information about actual and potential cost savings  and enforcement benefits from using ACE, we obtained information on  efforts by CBP, partner agencies, and companies involved in international  trade to identify and measure efficiency gains and potential cost savings.  The CBP documents we reviewed included listings and definitions of  metrics for determining efficiency gains and CBP\u2019s method for using  those to calculate potential cost savings, and also documentation of  CBP\u2019s process for determining the reliability of the data and measures. In  addition, we reviewed a 2015 report on CBP\u2019s ACE metrics by the DHS  Office of the Inspector General, which recommended that CBP strengthen  its metrics; the Inspector General subsequently closed those  recommendations as implemented. On the basis of our review of the  available information, we determined that CBP\u2019s metrics were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of conveying the estimated value of these  efficiency gains. To understand earlier CBP estimates of potential cost  savings from ACE, we reviewed a cost-benefit analysis conducted and  revised by CBP during 2002-2004. We also reviewed a more recent cost  benefit analysis conducted by FDA. In addition, we interviewed officials at  CBP and the 5 case study partner agencies regarding information on  potential cost savings and other benefits from ACE, including officials in  CBP\u2019s Office of Enforcement who discussed challenges with developing  metrics to measure enforcement benefits. In addition, to obtain  information on observed and potentials benefits and cost savings of ACE  to importers and exporters, and related companies, we interviewed  representatives of these companies. We also obtained information from  CBP regarding their preparations to assess the benefits of enhancements  to ACE after core ACE capabilities are completed. We interviewed CBP  and agency officials in Washington, D.C., and at the ports of New York,  N.Y., and Newark, N.J., concerning benefits and challenges associated  with using ACE. We selected these ports because they allowed us to  interview CBP officials charged with processing a large volume of diverse  imported goods, representing both air and sea cargo. These ports also  afforded an opportunity to interview field staff representing four of our five  case-study agencies (APHIS, CPSC, FDA, and FWS). We also discussed  these issues with CBP officials with the agency\u2019s Center for Commercial  Targeting and Analysis, each of CBP\u2019s five National Targeting and  Analysis Groups, and six of the agency\u2019s 10 Centers of Excellence and  Expertise (national-level CBP units responsible for processing imported  goods associated with designated industry sectors), which we  judgmentally selected. We also discussed these issues with 16 trade  community representatives\u2014that is, representatives of companies that  buy and sell internationally traded products as well as brokers and  shippers that work for and with these companies\u2014some of whom  participate in organizations that advise CBP regarding its operations.  These 16 representatives included members of the Trade Support  Network, a private sector group created to provide input to CBP on its  business processes, including ACE; the Commercial Customs Operations  Advisory Committee, a private sector group created to advise the  Departments of the Treasury and Homeland Security on CBP\u2019s  commercial operations; and the National Customs Brokers and Freight  Forwarders Association.\nTo analyze the approach that will be used to manage ACE after core  capabilities have been completed, we obtained information on CBP  processes to identify, evaluate, and operationalize changes to enhance  ACE. We also obtained information from CBP about its projected \u201cpost- core\u201d budgetary needs. In addition, we reviewed documentation from  CBP regarding interagency dialogue on post-core management of ACE  and interviewed officials from CBP and other agencies to obtain their  views on the challenges to be addressed and progress toward addressing  them.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to February  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\n\nAppendix II: Partner Agency Participation in ACE\n\nTable 4 provides information about participation in U.S. Customs and  Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) by  the 22 partner agencies that CBP identified as requiring documentation to  clear or license cargo. Table 5 provides information about participation in  ACE by the 27 partner agencies that CBP did not identify as requiring  such documentation.\n\nAppendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security\n\nAppendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\n\n\tGAO Contact\n\n\tStaff Acknowledgments\n\nIn addition to the contact named above, Celia Thomas (Assistant  Director), Michael McAtee (Analyst-in-Charge), Marybeth Acac, Ryan  Deloughry, Philip Farah, Reid Lowe, Scott McClinton, Maria Stattel,  Bryant Torres, and Alex Welsh made key contributions to this report. Neil  Doherty and Justine Lazaro provided technical assistance.\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "Why GAO Did This Study\n\nCBP began work on ACE in 1994 to update the agency's existing electronic trade processing system. In 2006, Congress broadened this effort by mandating creation of a \u201csingle portal\u201d International Trade Data System to, among other things, efficiently regulate the flow of commerce and more effectively enforce laws and regulations relating to international trade. Performance problems halted implementation of ACE from 2010 to 2013. In 2014, the President set a deadline of December 31, 2016, for completing the system.\nThe Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 included a provision for GAO to report on issues related to ACE implementation. In this report, GAO examines (1) CBP efforts to complete core ACE capabilities since 2013; (2) agencies' access to ACE and use of the system to process imports; (3) any cost savings and trade enforcement benefits from using ACE; and (4) the approach that will be used to manage ACE after core capabilities are completed. GAO reviewed information from 22 agencies as well as importers, exporters, and brokers and interviewed agency and trade community representatives.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nSince renewing efforts to implement the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) in 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has deployed a number of key ACE activities, processes, and functions that it terms core capabilities. After several delays, CBP reported that it had finished implementing these capabilities\u2014other than a capability for revenue collections\u2014in February 2018. CBP expects to decide how to proceed with collections by the end of March 2018, according to agency officials.\nThe 22 agencies CBP identified as requiring documentation to clear or license cargo are all authorized to access ACE, although GAO found considerable variation in their use of the system for import processing. For example, the Food and Drug Administration has integrated its systems with ACE and uses ACE data to review imports under its jurisdiction and target public health risks. In contrast, the Fish and Wildlife Service has not yet integrated ACE into its operations.\nACE users at CBP and partner agencies and in the trade community told GAO that using ACE has reduced costs by making trade processing more efficient and has strengthened enforcement of trade laws and regulations. CBP has developed metrics for itself and the trade community and estimated savings that could result from the increased efficiency of some processes in ACE. CBP also reported efforts to expand its metrics to capture more ACE benefits\u2014for example, to estimate the value of increased efficiencies for partner agencies.\nCBP has not yet established an approach for the management of ACE after February 2018. The agency plans to enhance ACE to address shortcomings ACE users have identified\u2014such as difficulty in transmitting messages and required information \u2014but has not established a process for prioritizing all suggested enhancements. CBP also has not identified funding for continued ACE development, including enhancements, after fiscal year 2018. CBP is leading an interagency effort to develop an ACE management approach that includes processes for prioritizing enhancements and sharing costs, but this approach has not been finalized. Federal guidance calls for establishing the organizational structure necessary to operate effectively and for examining efforts as needed to adopt coordinated approaches. Until processes for prioritizing ACE enhancements and sharing costs are finalized, agencies and the trade community will not realize the system's full potential benefits.\n\nWhat GAO Recommends\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security should ensure that the Commissioner of CBP, in collaboration with partner agencies, finalizes an interagency approach to managing ACE that includes processes for prioritizing enhancements and sharing system costs. CBP concurred with GAO's recommendation.",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBackground\n\n\t\tDOD Public Water Systems\n\nDOD has two types of public water systems that provide drinking water to  people that live and work on military installations. The first type provides  drinking water that has been treated by DOD. The second type provides  water treated by a private company or a local utility, which we refer to as  \u201cnon-DOD-treated\u201d drinking water. Drinking water systems vary by size  and other factors, but they most typically include a supply source,  treatment facility, and distribution system. A water system\u2019s supply source  may be a reservoir, aquifer, well, or a combination of these sources. The  treatment process for surface water generally uses sedimentation,  filtration, and other processes to remove impurities and harmful agents,  and disinfection processes such as chlorination to eliminate biological  contaminants. Distribution systems are comprised of water towers, piping  grids, pumps, and other components to deliver treated water from  treatment systems to consumers.\n\n\t\tDrinking Water Regulations and Administrative Orders\n\nEPA regulates drinking water contaminants under the Safe Drinking  Water Act by issuing legally enforceable standards, known as National  Primary Drinking Water Regulations, which generally limit the levels of  these contaminants in public water systems. EPA has issued such  regulations for approximately 90 drinking water contaminants. In  accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA may authorize a state  to have primary enforcement responsibility for drinking water regulations,  as long as the state has, among other things, drinking water regulations  that are no less stringent than the National Primary Drinking Water  Regulations.\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act also authorizes EPA to take emergency  actions necessary to protect public health when informed that a  contaminant is present in or is likely to enter a public water system or an  underground source of drinking water that may present an imminent and  substantial endangerment. For example, EPA may issue administrative  orders, which generally include actions to be taken, such as remediating  contaminated sources of drinking water or requiring the provision of  alternative water supplies. State regulators may also issue orders to  public water systems to address contaminated drinking water.\nPublic water systems, including the DOD public water systems that  provide drinking water to about 3 million people living and working on  military installations, are required to comply with EPA and state drinking  water regulations. EPA divides violations of drinking water regulations  into two types: (1) health-based violations and (2) other types of  violations that include violations of monitoring, reporting, and public  notification requirements. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA also  is required to identify unregulated contaminants that present the greatest  health concern, establish a program to monitor drinking water for  unregulated contaminants, and decide whether or not to regulate at least  five such contaminants every 5 years. EPA has not regulated any new  contaminants using this process since 1996.\nDOD\u2019s environmental compliance policy states that ASD (EI&E) is  responsible for providing guidance, oversight, advocacy, and  representation for environmental compliance programs\u2014to include  overseeing the military departments\u2019 compliance with health-based  drinking water regulations at DOD public water systems. The policy  directs the military departments to annually report to ASD (EI&E) the total  population receiving water from both \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cother\u201d DOD public  water systems\u2014referred to in this report as DOD public water systems  that provide DOD- and non-DOD-treated drinking water, respectively\u2014 that did and did not attain all Safe Drinking Water Act health-based  drinking water standards. The policy also requires the military  departments to report information regarding each instance health-based  drinking water standards were not attained during the reporting period, to  include the name and location of the military installation; the nature of the  issue (e.g., the contaminant type); the DOD population affected; the  duration of the issue; the corrective actions taken or planned (e.g.,  flushing the system, resampling the water, or implementing system  upgrades); and the estimated date for achieving the standard.\n\n\t\tEPA Health Advisories\n\nIn addition to issuing drinking water regulations, EPA may also publish  drinking water health advisories. In contrast to drinking water regulations,  health advisories are nonenforceable. Drinking water health advisories  provide technical guidance on health effects, analytical methodologies,  and treatment technologies. These advisories recommend the amount of  these contaminants that can be present in drinking water\u2014\u201dhealth  advisory levels\u201d\u2014at which adverse health effects are not anticipated to  occur over specific exposure durations, to include 1 day, 10 days, several  years, or over a lifetime. EPA issues provisional health advisories to  provide information in response to an urgent or rapidly developing  situation. DOD\u2019s list of emerging contaminants includes 11  contaminants, including PFOS, PFOA, and perchlorate, for which EPA  has issued a drinking water health advisory. Specifically,\nPFOS. PFOS is part of a larger group of fluorinated organic chemicals  that have been incorporated into an array of consumer products (i.e.,  to make some more resistant to stains, grease, and water) and also in  firefighting foam used by DOD and civilian airports. According to EPA,  the major manufacturer of PFOS in the United States voluntarily  agreed to phase out production of the chemical in 2002. According to  EPA\u2019s health advisory, exposure to PFOS may remain possible due to  legacy uses, existing and legacy use in imported goods, and the  chemical\u2019s \u201cextremely high persistence\u201d in the environment. According  to the EPA, exposure to PFOS may result in adverse health effects,  such as fetal developmental effects during pregnancy or to breastfed  infants, cancer, liver damage, immune effects, thyroid effects, and  other effects. See table 1 for details of the EPA provisional health  advisory that was issued in 2009 and the lifetime health advisory that  was issued in 2016, which superseded the provisional health  advisory.\nPFOA. PFOA is a fluorinated organic chemical that has been used in  generally the same products as PFOS, including firefighting foam  used by DOD and civilian airports. According to EPA, PFOA was  voluntarily phased out by eight major companies in the manufacturing  of their products at the end of 2015. According to the EPA, adverse  health effects from exposure to PFOA are similar to those for PFOS.  See table 1 for details of the EPA provisional health advisory that was  issued in 2009 and the lifetime health advisory that was issued in  2016, which superseded the provisional health advisory.\nPerchlorate. Perchlorate is commonly used in solid propellants,  fireworks, matches, signal flares, and some fertilizers, and has been  used by DOD for rocket fuel and ammunition. EPA published an  interim health advisory for perchlorate in 2008; the interim health  advisory level was set at 15 parts per billion. According to the health  advisory, perchlorate can disrupt the functions of the thyroid gland.\n\n\t\tDOD-Identified Emerging Contaminants\n\nIn 2009, DOD issued a policy on the identification, assessment, and risk  management of emerging contaminants that have the potential to impact  DOD. According to that policy, chemicals and materials used or planned  for use by DOD that meet the definition of an emerging contaminant  should be identified as early as possible. The policy further states that  DOD is to assess and, when appropriate, take action to reduce risks  posed by its emerging contaminants to people; the environment; and  DOD missions, programs, and resources. Where necessary, DOD is to  perform sampling, conduct site-specific risk assessments, and take  response actions for emerging contaminants released from DOD facilities,  in accordance with relevant statutes.\nAccording to the DOD policy on emerging contaminants, ASD (EI&E) is to  develop and maintain a list of emerging contaminants with potential or  probable high risk to the department\u2019s personnel and functions. As of  April 2017, DOD\u2019s list of emerging contaminants comprised 49 chemicals  or substances. According to our analysis of EPA documents, DOD\u2019s list  includes 21 contaminants that can be found in drinking water. Of these 21  contaminants, 10 contaminants have been regulated by EPA under the  Safe Drinking Water Act, and 11 contaminants are currently unregulated  but have an EPA-issued drinking water health advisory. The other 28  DOD-identified emerging contaminants do not have EPA drinking water  regulations or health advisories. Appendix II provides more information on  the drinking water regulatory status of DOD-identified emerging  contaminants.\n\n\tDOD Has Not Internally Reported All Data on Compliance with Drinking Water Regulations or Used Available Data to Evaluate Differences between Its Drinking Water Systems\n\nFor the years we reviewed\u2014fiscal years 2013 through 2015\u2014the military  departments annually reported information internally to ASD (EI&E) on  compliance with EPA and state health-based drinking water regulations,  which indicate that drinking water quality at DOD public water systems  was similar to other systems in the United States. However, not all  violations of health-based regulations were reported to ASD (EI&E) during  this time frame, as is required by DOD policy. The military departments  reported that a total of 77 military installations had at least one violation at  some point from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2015, but we found  that at least 16 additional installations had violations that were reported to  EPA but were not internally reported to ASD (EI&E). DOD also has not  used available compliance data to identify why DOD public water systems  that provide DOD-treated drinking water appear to have more violations  of health-based regulations than DOD systems that provide non-DOD- treated drinking water.\n\n\t\tMilitary Departments Have Internally Reported Data on Compliance with Health-Based Drinking Water Regulations, but Have Not Reported All Violations\n\nFor the years we reviewed\u2014fiscal years 2013 through 2015\u2014the military  departments annually reported information to ASD (EI&E) on compliance  with and violations of EPA and state health-based drinking water  regulations at the DOD public water systems that provide drinking water  to military installations. The military departments\u2019 data for fiscal years  2013 through 2015 indicate that about 92 percent of people who received  drinking water from DOD public water systems were served by a system  that complied with EPA and state health-based regulations. This is similar  to the percentage of people in the United States\u2014also about 92 percent,  according to EPA\u2014who received drinking water during that time frame  from a community public water system with no health-based violations.  The data for that time period also indicate that about 8 percent of people  were provided drinking water from a DOD public water system that had at  least one violation of a health-based regulation. Health-based violations  can be for any length of time during a fiscal year\u2014for example, a violation  lasting 1 day is counted the same as a violation lasting for 1 month.  Across the 3 fiscal years, the military departments reported that a total of  77 military installations had at least one violation at some point during that  time period: 35 in fiscal year 2013, 25 in fiscal year 2014, and 17 in fiscal  year 2015. The most common types of contaminants for which the military  departments reported violations were coliform and two disinfection  byproducts\u2014trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids\u2014which, according to EPA, are among the most common types of contaminants for which  health-based drinking water violations occur across the United States.\nHowever, we found that the military departments have not always  reported all violations to ASD (EI&E), as required by DOD policy. Based  on our review of data in EPA\u2019s Safe Drinking Water Information System  for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, we found that the military departments  did not report violations to ASD (EI&E) for at least 16 installations\u20149 Air  Force installations, 5 Navy installations, and 2 Army installations.  According to EPA\u2019s database, the total population served by DOD public  water systems at these installations is approximately 180,000 people, and  most of the violations that went unreported involved coliform and  disinfection byproduct contaminants. However, the actual population  number affected by these violations and the contaminants involved\u2014 along with other information such as the duration of the contamination  and the corrective actions planned or taken\u2014were not included in the  military departments\u2019 annual reports to ASD (EI&E). These violations  were recorded in EPA\u2019s system, which indicates that the installations  reported the violations to the appropriate state regulatory agencies, who  then reported them to EPA\u2019s database. However, the violations were not  reported to ASD (EI&E), as required by DOD policy.\nAccording to military department officials, violations of health-based  drinking water regulations went unreported to ASD (EI&E) due to a lack of  clarity in DOD\u2019s reporting requirements and misunderstandings of the  requirements on the part of installations and the military departments. We  found that violations were either not reported by the military installations  where the violations occurred or that they were not reported by the  installations\u2019 chains of command. Navy officials cited turnover of  installation personnel as the reason some violations went unreported, as  well as misinterpretations by installation personnel of DOD\u2019s reporting  requirements. Air Force officials also told us that most of their unreported  violations were not reported to ASD (EI&E) because the Air Force did not  interpret them as health-based violations, although DOD policy requires  these types of violations to be reported. Army officials told us that,  based on their interpretation of DOD\u2019s policy, the policy did not require  them to report violations at installations where formal, written notification  was not received from the state regulatory agency. However, ASD (EI&E)  officials stated that all violations of health-based regulations should be  reported, whether or not the state provides formal, written notification of  the violation. Navy officials also told us that they have not reported  violations at some of the Navy\u2019s smaller systems that purchase drinking  water from non-DOD public water systems, due in part to  misinterpretation of DOD\u2019s internal reporting requirements. However,  Navy officials told us that ASD (EI&E) had instructed them to begin  reporting these types of violations in fiscal year 2016, and the Navy is  working with ASD (EI&E) and the other military departments to determine  whether these types of systems should regularly report health-based  violations.\nCurrently, ASD (EI&E) does not have complete data in accordance with  DOD\u2019s policy, limiting its ability to conduct oversight and analyze how  many people at military installations receive drinking water with health- based violations, what contaminants were involved, the duration of the  contamination, or what corrective actions the military departments have  planned or taken to address the violation. Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government states that quality information is needed to  achieve an organization\u2019s objectives. Those standards also indicate that  actions such as improved communication to and additional training for  personnel are helpful for an organization to meet its objectives.  According to DOD officials, a committee comprised of ASD (EI&E) and  military department officials began a review in 2016 of DOD\u2019s internal  reporting requirements for drinking water compliance data. While such a  committee could be in a position to make recommendations on clarifying  the annual reporting requirements, no documentation on the committee\u2019s  efforts was yet available at the time of our review as the committee\u2019s work  was still in progress. In addition, at present, there are no firm dates for  when its work will be completed or when any potential changes would be  implemented. Absent actions by ASD (EI&E) to identify and implement  any necessary changes to clarify annual reporting requirements in its  environmental compliance policy, and absent actions by the military  departments to increase understanding at their installations and  commands about the requirements, adherence to DOD\u2019s environmental  compliance policy will remain limited and DOD will lack complete data to  conduct oversight of regulatory compliance at its public water systems.\n\n\t\tDOD Has Not Used Available Data to Assess Why DOD-Treated Water Appears to Have More Health-Based Violations Than Non-DOD-Treated Drinking Water\n\nDOD has not used available data to assess why DOD public water  systems providing DOD-treated drinking water appear to have more  violations of health-based drinking water regulations than systems  providing non-DOD-treated drinking water. Although we found that not all  violations were reported by the military departments to ASD (EI&E), the  data that were reported during fiscal years 2013 through 2015 indicated  that about 99 percent of the people who received non-DOD-treated  drinking water were served by systems with no violations, while about 89  percent of the people who received DOD-treated drinking water were  served by systems with no violations.\nWhen we asked ASD (EI&E) and military department officials why these  differences may exist, they were unable to provide an explanation  because they had not used the reported water quality data to identify the  reasons why DOD public water systems providing DOD-treated water  appear to have more violations than systems providing non-DOD-treated  water. Although some officials offered ideas on the reasons for  differences in compliance\u2014including the relative expertise of utilities and  private companies, versus DOD, in providing drinking water\u2014DOD  officials acknowledged that the agency has not evaluated the data to  identify specific reasons for why the differences may exist. All public  water systems, including DOD public water systems, are required to  comply with applicable EPA and state drinking water regulations.  According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  management should establish and operate activities to monitor the  internal control system and evaluate the results. Such monitoring should  assess the quality of performance over time and promptly resolve any  findings. Without reviewing the data reported by the military  departments to identify why there appear to be differences in violations  between DOD\u2019s two types of public water systems and without identifying  and implementing any actions to address any differences, ASD (EI&E)  and the military departments may not be able to improve overall  compliance with health-based drinking water regulations.\n\n\tDOD Has Initiated Actions to Address Concerns with Its Firefighting Foam as Well as Elevated Levels of PFOS, PFOA, and Perchlorate in Drinking Water\n\nDOD is taking steps to address health and environmental concerns with  its use of firefighting foam that contains PFCs\u2014including PFOS and  PFOA\u2014to include restricting the use of foam at its installations and  funding research into the development of a PFC-free foam that can meet  DOD performance requirements. DOD also has responded to EPA and  state orders and initiated additional actions to address elevated levels of  PFOS, PFOA, and perchlorate.\n\n\t\tDOD Is Taking Steps to Address Health and Environmental Concerns with Firefighting Foam That Contains PFCs\n\nDOD is taking steps to address PFOS- and PFOA-related health and  environmental concerns with its use of firefighting foam that contains  PFCs. Firefighting foam is used by DOD to put fires out quickly while  also ensuring that they do not reignite. This is critical if, for example, there  is a fire from a fighter jet on the deck of an aircraft carrier. DOD has  outlined performance requirements in its military specification for  firefighting foam, which was authored by the Navy\u2019s Naval Sea Systems  Command but is approved for use in all of DOD. For example, the  military specification states how long it should take for firefighting foam to  extinguish a fire\u2014based on the size of the fire and the amount of foam  used\u2014and how long the foam should prevent the extinguished fire from  reigniting. DOD\u2019s military specification also requires that firefighting  foam purchased and used by the department must contain PFCs.\nDOD\u2019s steps to address concerns with the use of firefighting foam include  restricting the use of existing foams that contain PFCs; testing its current  foams to identify the amount of PFCs they contain; and funding research  into the future development of PFC-free foam that can meet DOD\u2019s  performance and compatibility requirements (see table 2). Some of these  steps, such as limiting the use of firefighting foam containing PFCs, are in  place. Others, such as determining the specific amount of PFCs in  existing firefighting foams or researching potential PFC-free firefighting  foams, are in progress with targets, in some cases, but no firm completion  dates.\nNavy officials stated that they are planning to revise the military  specification after they have completed their testing\u2014to be completed in  late 2017 or 2018\u2014on the amounts of PFOS, PFOA, and other PFCs  found in the firefighting foam currently used by DOD. That revision,  according to Navy officials, is intended to set limits for the amount of  PFCs that are allowed in firefighting foam. According to DOD, at present  there is no PFC-free firefighting foam that meets DOD\u2019s performance and  compatibility requirements. As a result, the Navy has no plans to remove  the requirement for firefighting foam to contain PFCs at this time.  However, if a PFC-free foam is developed in the future that can meet  DOD performance and compatibility requirements, Navy officials said that  any necessary revisions to the military specification would be made at  that time\u2014a process that could take months to complete.\n\n\t\tDOD Has Responded to Orders from EPA and a State Regulator and Has Initiated Additional Actions to Address Elevated Levels of PFOS and PFOA in Drinking Water at or near Military Installations\n\nDOD has taken steps to respond to four administrative orders directing  the department to address PFOS and PFOA levels that exceeded EPA\u2019s  health advisory levels for drinking water. One order was issued by the  Ohio Environmental Protection Agency at Wright-Patterson Air Force  Base in Ohio, and three orders were issued by the EPA directed at: the  former Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire; Horsham Air Guard  Station in Pennsylvania; and the former Naval Air Warfare Center  Warminster in Pennsylvania. Under Section 1431 of the Safe Drinking  Water Act, EPA may issue orders necessary to protect human health  where a contaminant in a public water system presents an imminent and  substantial endangerment. EPA may do so if appropriate state and local  authorities have not acted to protect human health. These orders may  require, among other things, carrying out cleanup studies, providing  alternate water supplies, notifying the public of the emergency, and  halting disposal of the contaminants threatening human health. The Ohio  Environmental Protection Agency has similar authority.\nAccording to information provided by officials from the Ohio  Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and DOD, DOD has taken steps  to respond to the administrative orders. Table 3 provides further details  on each order and examples of actions by DOD to address the orders.\nIn addition to actions specific to these four installations, DOD has initiated  other actions to test for, investigate, and mitigate elevated levels of PFOS  and PFOA at or near installations across the military departments.  Following the release of EPA\u2019s lifetime health advisory for PFOS and  PFOA in May 2016, each of the military departments issued guidance  directing installations to, among other things, test for PFOS and PFOA in  their drinking water and take steps to address drinking water that  contained amounts of PFOS and PFOA above the EPA\u2019s lifetime health  advisory level. The military departments also directed their installations to  identify locations with a known or suspected prior release of PFOS and  PFOA and to address any releases that pose a risk to human health\u2014 which can include people living outside DOD installations.\nAs a result of these efforts, DOD has initiated actions to address PFOS  and PFOA in drinking water both on military installations and outside  military installations. As of March 2017, DOD data indicated that the  department was taking steps to address levels of PFOS and PFOA above  the EPA\u2019s lifetime health advisory level in drinking water on 11 military  installations in the United States, 2 of which we visited during the course  of this review (see fig. 1).\nAccording to DOD data, these installations took various corrective actions  to mitigate the presence of PFOS and PFOA in the drinking water,  including shutting down drinking water wells, providing alternative drinking  water, and installing treatment systems. For example, at Eielson Air Force  Base in Alaska, the Air Force reported shutting down three of the  installation\u2019s six drinking water wells and installing a treatment system to  remove PFOS and PFOA from the drinking water. At Marine Corps Base  Camp Pendleton in California, the Navy reported that a well contaminated  with PFOS and PFOA was taken out of service and that the affected  reservoir was drained and replaced with water from another source;  follow-on testing showed that the presence of PFOS and PFOA were  returned to below the EPA\u2019s lifetime health advisory level. At Fort  Leavenworth in Kansas, the Army reported that the private company that  operates the installation\u2019s drinking water system had shut down two wells  contaminated with PFOS and PFOA and plans to install a treatment  system before returning those wells to service.\nAdditionally, according to DOD data as of December 2016 the military  departments had identified 391 active and closed installations with  known or suspected releases of PFOS and PFOA, and had reported  spending almost $200 million on environmental investigations and  mitigation actions at or near 263 (or about 67 percent) of those  installations. In particular, DOD had initiated mitigation actions, which  include installing treatment systems or supplying bottled water, to address  PFOS and PFOA in drinking water for people living outside 19  installations\u20145 of which we visited during the course of this review (see  fig. 2).\nThe following cost data provided by DOD were current as of December  2016, and are supplemented by additional information we obtained during  our installation visits.\nThe Air Force identified 203 installations with known or suspected  releases of PFOS and PFOA, spent about $120 million on  environmental investigations at those installations, and spent about  $33 million on mitigation actions at or near 14 of the 203 installations.  For example, the Air Force reported spending over $5 million on  environmental investigations and mitigation actions at Peterson Air  Force Base in Colorado. During our visit to that installation, officials  showed us the sites they are investigating\u2014to include the current (see  fig. 3 below) and former fire training areas\u2014to determine the extent to  which their prior use of firefighting foam may have contributed to the  discovery of PFOS and PFOA in the drinking water of three nearby  communities. Additionally, the Air Force has awarded a contract for,  among other things, installing treatment systems in those  communities. In another example, the Air Force reported spending  about $800,000 on environmental investigations at Joint Base  Langley-Eustis in Virginia, but nothing yet on mitigation actions.  During our visit to this installation, officials told us that they had not  taken any mitigation actions because they do not use the installation\u2019s  groundwater as a drinking water source; the utility that serves the  installation, as well as the nearby city of Newport News, obtains its  drinking water primarily from a surface water source, which officials  said was approximately 20 miles from the installation.\nThe Navy identified 127 installations with known or suspected  releases of PFOS and PFOA, spent about $20.5 million on  environmental investigations at 47 of those installations, and spent  about $24 million on mitigation actions at or near 5 of those  installations. For example, the Navy reported spending about $15  million on environmental investigations and mitigation actions at the  former Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove in  Pennsylvania. During our visit to this installation, officials told us that  the Navy is investigating the extent to which PFOS and PFOA on the  installation may have contaminated a nearby town\u2019s drinking water.  The Navy has agreed to fund installation of treatment systems and  connections of private well owners to the town\u2019s drinking water  system, among other things. In another example, the Navy reported  spending nearly $3 million on environmental investigations and  mitigation actions at Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Fentress in  Virginia. During our visit to this installation, officials told us that the  Navy is providing bottled water to the approximately 20 to 30  personnel who work there and plans to install a treatment system to  treat for PFOS and PFOA.\nThe Army identified 61 installations with known or suspected releases  of PFOS and PFOA, spent about $1.6 million on environmental  investigations at 13 of those installations, and has not yet begun any  mitigation actions at or near the identified installations. For example,  the Army reported spending about $26,000 on environmental  investigations at Fort Carson in Colorado, but nothing yet on  mitigation actions. During our visit to this installation, officials told us  that they had found PFOS and PFOA in groundwater near their  previous fire training area but that the installation does not use that  groundwater as a drinking water source, and state officials told us that  it is unlikely that PFOS and PFOA from Fort Carson had affected any  nearby drinking water sources.\nAccording to DOD, it may take several years for the department to  determine how much it will cost to cleanup PFOS and PFOA  contamination at or near its military installations. In January 2017, we  reported that DOD had not notified Congress that the costs for  environmental cleanup at closed installations will significantly increase  due to the high cost of remediating emerging contaminants\u2014including  PFOS and PFOA. We also reported that DOD officials had not  determined the total costs for cleaning up emerging contaminants at  closed installations. We recommended that DOD include in future annual  reports to Congress best estimates of the environmental cleanup costs for  emerging contaminants as additional information becomes available, and  DOD concurred with the recommendation and stated its commitment to  do so.\n\n\t\tDOD Previously Directed Installations to Test for Perchlorate in Drinking Water\n\nDOD previously directed installations to test for perchlorate in drinking  water. Following the EPA\u2019s issuance of an interim drinking water health  advisory for perchlorate in 2008, DOD issued policy in April 2009\u2014which  superseded similar policy that was issued in January 2006\u2014directing  DOD-owned drinking water systems that were testing for inorganic  substances to also test for perchlorate. Installations that found  perchlorate in their drinking water were to consult with their leadership on  appropriate actions to take and to continue testing on a quarterly basis  until they determined that perchlorate levels were likely to remain below  EPA\u2019s health advisory level, or any applicable federal or state regulation.  Citing congressional and regulatory agency concerns related to  perchlorate, DOD developed a database for storing the results of  perchlorate testing. According to ASD (EI&E), the database was last  updated in 2009 and is no longer being used by the department.\nASD (EI&E) officials stated that they are no longer regularly testing  drinking water for perchlorate unless there is a state requirement to do so;  previous testing indicated that DOD was not a primary source of  perchlorate in drinking water and that known releases of perchlorate did  not currently pose a threat to drinking water. According to EPA, the  agency expects to issue a final drinking water regulation for perchlorate  by the end of 2019. ASD (EI&E) officials told us that, once EPA has  issued a final regulation, DOD is committed to complying with it.\n\n\tConclusions\n\nDuring the period we reviewed, DOD data indicate that DOD public water  systems complied with EPA and state health-based drinking water  regulations at a level comparable with other systems in the United States.  However, we found that the military departments did not report all  violations of these regulations to ASD (EI&E) during that period, which  illustrates that DOD\u2019s internal reporting requirements for drinking water  data are either not clear in DOD regulations or are not clearly understood  by those implementing them. Unless ASD (EI&E) and the military  departments act to make any necessary clarifications to and increase  understanding of DOD\u2019s annual reporting requirements, ASD (EI&E) may  not have complete data to effectively oversee the military departments\u2019  compliance with drinking water regulations. Further, the data indicated  that systems providing DOD-treated drinking water had more reported  health-based violations than DOD systems providing non-DOD-treated  drinking water. However, DOD has not used these data to identify the  reasons that these differences may exist. Without using available data to  identify why differences in violations appear to exist between DOD\u2019s two  types of public water systems, DOD will likely be hampered in its ability to  identify what actions, if any, could be taken to address any differences  and improve overall compliance with health-based drinking water  regulations.\n\n\tRecommendations for Executive Action\n\nWe are making a total of five recommendations to DOD.\nThe Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and  Environment, in consultation with the Secretaries of the military  departments, should identify and implement any necessary changes to  DOD\u2019s environmental compliance policy to clarify DOD\u2019s reporting  requirements for violations of health-based drinking water regulations.  (Recommendation 1)\nThe Secretary of the Army should identify and implement actions to  increase understanding at Army installations and commands about  DOD\u2019s reporting requirements for violations of health-based drinking  water regulations. These actions may include improved communication to  or additional training for personnel. (Recommendation 2)\nThe Secretary of the Navy should identify and implement actions to  increase understanding at Navy installations and commands about DOD\u2019s  reporting requirements for violations of health-based drinking water  regulations. These actions may include improved communication to or  additional training for personnel. (Recommendation 3)\nThe Secretary of the Air Force should identify and implement actions to  increase understanding at Air Force installations and commands about  DOD\u2019s reporting requirements for violations of health-based drinking  water regulations. These actions may include improved communication to  or additional training for personnel. (Recommendation 4)\nThe Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and  Environment, in consultation with the Secretaries of the military  departments, should (a) review reported compliance data to identify the  reasons for any differences in the number of violations of health-based  drinking water regulations between DOD\u2019s two types of public water  systems and (b) identify and implement any actions needed to address  the causes of any differences in the number of violations between DOD\u2019s  two types of public water systems. (Recommendation 5)\n\n\tAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\n\nWe provided a draft of this report to DOD and EPA for review and  comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix III, DOD  concurred with our recommendations. DOD and EPA also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. Based on  technical comments from DOD, we revised the title of the report to more  clearly specify the actions DOD should take to address the findings in our  report.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Energy, Installations, and Environment; the Secretaries of the Army,  the Navy, and the Air Force; and the Administrator of EPA.

This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1)  internally reported data on compliance with health-based drinking water  regulations at military installations and used those data to assess  compliance at its two types of public water systems and (2) taken actions  to address concerns with its firefighting foam containing perfluorinated  chemicals (PFCs) and to address elevated levels of  perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and  perchlorate in drinking water at or near military installations.\nFor objective one, we reviewed DOD\u2019s policy on environmental  compliance in the United States, which directs the military departments to  annually report data to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,  Installations, and Environment (ASD (EI&E)) on compliance with and  violations of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state health- based drinking water regulations at military installations. We analyzed  data reported by the military departments to ASD (EI&E) on compliance  with and violations of health-based drinking water regulations at DOD  public water systems located at military installations in the United States  for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, the most recent data available at the  time of our review. We analyzed the data to identify (1) the number of  people served by DOD public water systems that complied with  applicable EPA and state health-based drinking water regulations during  the fiscal year and (2) the number of people served by DOD public water  systems that violated at least one of these regulations sometime during  the fiscal year. We performed this analysis for both types of DOD public  water systems\u2014those that provide DOD-treated drinking water, and  those that provide non-DOD-treated drinking water. We also used the  data to identify the military installations where the reported violations  occurred; the nature of the violation (including the contaminant involved);  and the number of people affected. Next, we collected data from EPA\u2019s  Safe Drinking Water Information System for all public water systems in  the United States. We used DOD-provided public water system  identification numbers to identify in the EPA system any violations for  health-based drinking water regulations at those DOD systems for fiscal  years 2013 through 2015. We then compared the violations found in  EPA\u2019s data to the data reported by the military departments to ASD  (EI&E) to determine the extent to which the military departments were  reporting all violations of health-based drinking water regulations to ASD  (EI&E).\nWe also analyzed DOD\u2019s data to identify any differences in violations  between DOD- and non-DOD-treated drinking water. We evaluated the  military departments\u2019 reported data and DOD\u2019s use of these data to  determine compliance with DOD\u2019s reporting requirements in the  department\u2019s environmental compliance instruction and Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. According to these  standards, quality information is needed to achieve an organization\u2019s  objectives, management is to monitor performance over time and  promptly resolve any findings, and actions such as improved  communication to and additional training for personnel are helpful for an  organization to meet its objectives. We also discussed our analysis with  ASD (EI&E) and military department officials, and discussed possible  reasons for why any violations went unreported to ASD (EI&E) and why  there may be differences in violations between DOD- and non-DOD- treated drinking water. We assessed the reliability of the DOD and EPA  data on violations of health-based drinking water regulations by reviewing  relevant documentation, testing the data for obvious errors, and  interviewing knowledgeable officials. As we have previously found, EPA\u2019s  data system may not contain all public water violations as states have  under-reported the violations. During this review, we found that some  public water system identification numbers for DOD installations could not  be matched with EPA\u2019s system and, therefore, were excluded from our  analysis. As a result, some DOD installation violations may be missing  from the data, and we may not have comprehensive violations data for  health-based drinking water regulations at DOD installations.  Nonetheless, we determined that DOD and EPA data were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of identifying whether any drinking water  violations were recorded in EPA\u2019s system but not internally reported  within DOD, and to indicate possible differences in drinking water  violations, as reported by the military departments, between DOD\u2019s two  types of public water systems.\nFor objective two, we reviewed policies issued by the military  departments on the use of firefighting foam that contains PFCs. We also  reviewed DOD documents related to research into PFC-free firefighting  foams that can meet the department\u2019s performance and compatibility  requirements, as well as DOD\u2019s military specification document that  outlines those requirements. We met with officials from ASD (EI&E) and  the military departments to discuss their policies on the use of firefighting  foam and actions taken to address concerns with the use of firefighting  foam containing PFCs, including the future use of firefighting foam.  Additionally, we met with Navy officials responsible for testing existing  firefighting foam products and setting the military specifications for  firefighting foam use in DOD.\nAdditionally, we obtained and reviewed four regulatory administrative  orders\u2014three from EPA and one from the Ohio Environmental Protection  Agency\u2014directing DOD to address elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA  contamination in drinking water at or near four active and closed military  installations, and reviewed documentation related to DOD\u2019s efforts to  address these administrative orders. We also met with officials from Ohio  and the EPA regions that issued the orders\u2014EPA Regions 1 and 3\u2014as  well as DOD officials who responded to the orders, to discuss DOD\u2019s  response to the orders. We reviewed drinking water guidance issued by  ASD (EI&E) and the military departments on testing installation drinking  water for PFOS and PFOA and responding to known or suspected  releases of PFOS and PFOA. We analyzed DOD-provided data on the  installations where DOD-conducted testing showed the presence of  PFOS and PFOA in drinking water above the EPA\u2019s health advisory level  for those contaminants (as of March 2017) and on the costs and actions  taken to investigate and mitigate PFOS and PFOA at or near military  installations (as of December 2016). We assessed the reliability of the  data by examining the data for obvious errors and inconsistencies,  comparing the data, where applicable, with other information collected,  and by interviewing knowledgeable officials; we found the data to be  sufficiently reliable for our purposes of describing what DOD has reported  on its actions and costs for responding to PFOS and PFOA.\nAdditionally, we reviewed DOD policy and our prior work on testing for  and responding to perchlorate at military installations. We met with ASD  (EI&E) and military department officials to discuss DOD actions to  address PFOS, PFOA, and perchlorate. To obtain additional information  on DOD actions to address emerging contaminants in drinking water, we  conducted site visits to a nongeneralizable sample of seven current and  former military installations\u2014at least two installations per military  department\u2014that were selected because they were investigating or  responding to unregulated DOD-identified emerging contaminants in  drinking water; these installations are listed below. We also met with  EPA and state regulatory officials to better understand how DOD was  responding to administrative orders and addressing PFOS, PFOA, and  perchlorate at or near DOD installations. Specifically, we met with officials  from selected EPA regions and state regulatory offices that had issued an  administrative order for PFOS and PFOA or whose region or state  included the installations we visited; those EPA regions and states are  listed below. We also compared DOD\u2019s list of emerging contaminants with  EPA documentation to determine how many DOD-identified emerging  contaminants (1) have been regulated by EPA under the Safe Drinking  Water Act or (2) are currently unregulated but have an EPA-issued  drinking water health advisory.\nWe visited or contacted the following offices and locations during our  review.

    "output": "Why GAO Did This Study\n\nAccording to DOD, about 3 million people in the United States receive drinking water from DOD public water systems, which are to comply with EPA and state health-based regulations. EPA and DOD have detected elevated levels of two unregulated, DOD-identified emerging contaminants found in firefighting foam\u2014PFOS and PFOA\u2014in drinking water at or near installations. Perchlorate, an unregulated chemical used by DOD in rocket fuel, can also be found in drinking water.\nThe Senate Report accompanying a bill for national defense authorization for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review DOD management of drinking water contaminants. This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1) internally reported data on compliance with health-based drinking water regulations at military installations and used those data to assess compliance at its two types of public water systems, and (2) taken actions to address concerns with its firefighting foam and elevated levels of PFOS, PFOA, and perchlorate in drinking water at or near military installations. GAO reviewed DOD guidance and EPA drinking water regulations, advisories, and orders; analyzed DOD and EPA drinking water data; and visited seven installations from among those addressing emerging contaminants in drinking water.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) has not internally reported all data on compliance with health-based drinking water regulations or used available data to assess compliance. DOD data for fiscal years 2013-2015 indicate that DOD public water systems complied with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state health-based drinking water regulations at levels comparable with other systems in the United States. However, the military departments did not report all violations to DOD, i.e., while 77 installations reported violations to DOD, GAO found that at least 16 additional installations did not. Until DOD takes steps to increase the clarity and understanding of its internal reporting requirements, it may not have the data it needs to fully oversee compliance. DOD also has not used its data to determine why its two types of systems\u2014one that provides DOD-treated water and another that provides non-DOD-treated water\u2014have different compliance rates. Specifically, DOD's data indicate that about 99 percent of the people who received non-DOD-treated drinking water were served by systems with no violations, while about 89 percent of the people who received DOD-treated drinking water were served by systems with no violations. Absent further analysis of its data, DOD may not be able to improve overall compliance.\nDOD has initiated actions to address concerns with both its firefighting foam and also with elevated levels in drinking water of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perchlorate, which are DOD-identified emerging contaminants. PFOS and PFOA can be found in DOD's firefighting foam. DOD has restricted its use of this foam and is funding efforts to develop a new foam that meets DOD performance requirements. Additionally, at 11 military installations (see fig.), DOD has shut down wells, provided alternate water sources, or installed water treatment systems to respond to elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA, at times in response to EPA and state orders.\n\nWhat GAO Recommends\n\nGAO is making five recommendations to improve DOD's reporting and use of data on compliance with health-based drinking water regulations. DOD concurred with the recommendations.",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBackground\n\nThe federal government is the largest real property owner in the United  States with a vast inventory costing billions of dollars annually to operate  and maintain. Federally owned buildings include courthouses, offices,  warehouses, schools, hospitals, housing, data centers, and laboratories,  among other things. GSA acts as the federal government\u2019s landlord, and  is responsible for designing, constructing, and managing federal buildings  for other federal agencies and the judiciary to occupy. There are  currently approximately 1,600 federally owned buildings under GSA\u2019s  custody and control.\nAccording to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), agencies,  including GSA, should have accurate information on acquisition and  \u201clifecycle\u201d costs of current and proposed assets, including costs for  designing and constructing the building, O&M, and disposal. For  example, when planning and designing new federal buildings, GSA must  analyze building energy and water systems (e.g., for air conditioning and  heating) to identify those with the lowest acquisition and operating costs.  In addition, once the building is constructed, GSA building managers and  O&M contractors are responsible for maintaining the building, which  includes tasks related to recurring maintenance and repair (e.g., on  heating and cooling systems), maintaining the property\u2019s roads and  grounds, cleaning and janitorial services, and paying for utilities.\nIn 1994, GSA instituted the Design Excellence Program, a process for  designing, constructing, renovating, altering, and repairing federal  courthouses and office buildings. This program was developed in  response to criticisms that federal buildings lacked architectural  distinction. It stresses creativity in the design of buildings with the intent of  constructing spaces that meet the tenant\u2019s functional needs while also  becoming public landmarks. More specifically, the program aims to meet  several guidelines\u2014called the Guiding Principles for Federal  Architecture\u2014 including designing spaces that:  reflect the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the U.S.  government; avoid uniformity; and are built in locations in which federal buildings can be incorporated  into the existing public streets and landscape.\nAccording to GSA officials, the Design Excellence Program also  streamlines how GSA selects and manages the private-sector architects  and engineering firms it hires for new projects. The process consists of  four primary stages: planning for the prospective tenant\u2019s needs and general project details  (e.g., request for proposal announcement);  selecting and working with an architectural and engineering firm to  design the building;  selecting a contractor to construct the building; and occupancy by the tenants.\nThe process is overseen by a GSA project team, consisting of a project  manager, contracting officer, officials from GSA\u2019s Office of the Chief  Architect, and additional subject matter experts, who work with the federal  tenant that plans to occupy the space.\nA large number of the federal courthouses and office buildings  constructed and controlled by GSA in the last 20 years have been  completed under the Design Excellence Program. Under the program,  GSA has constructed 78 facilities including 62 courthouses and 16 federal  office buildings, including a data center and laboratories. These  buildings account for more than 36-million square feet of space, are  located in 33 states and the District of Columbia, and many have won  architecture and design awards. Figure 1 shows examples of federal  courthouses and office buildings constructed under the Design  Excellence Program.\n\n\tGSA Made Design Choices That Decreased and Increased O&M Costs\n\n\t\tSome GSA Design Choices Have Decreased O&M Costs\n\nAccording to interviews with GSA officials and building tenants, GSA has  made choices in some Design Excellence buildings intended to reduce  long-term O&M costs. For example:  Increased natural light. All 10 of the Design Excellence buildings we  visited were designed to include interior natural light, which some  building managers reported reduced energy costs. According to GSA  officials, natural light is not only aesthetically pleasing; it also  improves lighting quality for building tenants and reduces lighting  costs. For example, the First Street Federal Courthouse (Los Angeles,  California) has a light well as part of its atrium and a serrated glass  fa\u00e7ade that maximizes natural light. Building officials said that 22 of  the 24 courtrooms in the building receive natural light from multiple  sources, reducing energy usage and requiring less frequent  replacement of lighting. In addition, building officials at the Albert  Armendariz, Sr., U.S. Courthouse (El Paso, Texas) reported extensive  natural light from a three story window wall and the front atrium; both  features provide ample light for building tenants. (See fig. 2).\nDurable and easily maintained materials and finishes. In most of the  10 Design Excellence buildings we visited, GSA officials and building  tenants reported selecting materials and finishes that (1) are highly  durable and easy and inexpensive to clean; (2) are expected to last a  long time; and (3) required little maintenance. For example, the lobby  walls and floors of the Ronald Reagan Federal Building and  Courthouse (Santa Ana, California) are made out of travertine, a very  durable stone, which has lasted more than 15 years without the need  for repairs or replacement. In addition, officials at a few buildings  noted that the decision to install carpet tiles in lieu of large patches of  carpet has made it very easy and relatively inexpensive to maintain  and repair office spaces and courtrooms.\nLow-maintenance landscaping. Several of the 10 Design Excellence  buildings we visited incorporated native flora into the landscape  design, which can reduce energy and water costs. For example,  officials planted native, drought resistant plants around the First Street  Federal Courthouse (Los Angeles, California). Building officials at the  Las Cruces U.S. Courthouse (Las Cruces, New Mexico), which is  located in a desert environment, also reported most of the native  landscape around the courthouse does not require watering.\n\n\t\tSome GSA Design Choices Have Increased O&M Costs\n\nAccording to our survey respondents\u2014building managers at all 78 Design  Excellence buildings included in our review\u2014certain GSA design choices,  such as multistory atriums and custom windows, have resulted in  increased O&M costs compared to an average GSA building without  those features. Almost all Design Excellence building managers (76 out  of 78) reported that certain design choices resulted in increased O&M  costs that would not have occurred had that design choice not been  selected. For example, 67 out of 78 building managers for Design  Excellence buildings stated that the effect of including multistory open  spaces, like atriums, increased O&M costs due to the challenges  associated with heating and cooling, making needed repairs, and  cleaning these spaces. (See table 1). Building managers and tenants we  spoke with confirmed our survey results, and provided examples of  design choices that resulted in unexpected O&M cost increases. For  example, officials noted increased O&M costs associated with separate  structures and multistory atriums that were difficult to access for cleaning  and repairs.\nSeparate Structures. Managers from only 21 of 78 Design Excellence  buildings reported having an attached, but separate structure (e.g.,  pavilions, rotundas, restaurants, and other additional spaces connected to  the building), but managers at 19 of those buildings stated that the effect  of such design features increased O&M costs. For example, one federal  building we visited had a rotunda with a domed roof that, according to  building managers, has multiple gutter leaks that are not currently  accessible due to the design of the space. As a result, maintenance staff  continuously patch the ceiling without addressing the cause of the leaks  (see fig. 3).\nAtriums and Lobbies. Managers from 67 of 78 Design Excellence  buildings reported their buildings\u2019 multistory atriums and lobbies  increased O&M costs. Several GSA managers we interviewed identified  additional costs to maintain a multistory atrium or lobby, including costs  for renting expensive scaffolding or mechanical lifts. For example, one  Design Excellence building we visited has water leaks in the lobby ceiling,  which can only be reached by extensive and expensive scaffolding (see  fig. 4).\nLarge, Custom Windows. Managers from 65 of 78 Design Excellence  buildings reported that the effect of design choices related to their  buildings\u2019 windows increased O&M costs. In addition, several Design  Excellence buildings we visited had custom or uniquely shaped windows,  which occasionally increased the costs to replace, repair, or maintain  them. For example, GSA officials at one courthouse reported repairing  one two-story, custom-made window pane, which cost $80,000 to  fabricate and $50,000 to install. The courthouse had eight of these  windows, and a GSA official stated that the windows are an attractive  feature of the building that introduced natural light, but a different window  choice would have been cheaper to maintain (see fig. 5).\nMission Spaces. Managers from 48 Design Excellence buildings reported  that the effect of design choices related to mission spaces (i.e., spaces in  which federal employees conduct work) increased O&M costs.  Specifically, managers from 32 buildings stated that design choices made  in mission spaces increased repair costs, and managers from 30  buildings reported increased cleaning costs. GSA officials at several  buildings we visited discussed challenges accessing and maintaining  mechanical systems incorporated into tenant mission spaces. For  example, one Design Excellence building includes a heating, ventilation,  and air-conditioning (HVAC) system that is hidden under a raised floor  within mission spaces. Because building managers cannot easily access  the system, there are maintenance delays and challenges identifying and  making necessary repairs, which ultimately result in higher O&M costs.  Building officials reported they considered replacing the HVAC system,  but doing so would cost approximately $55 million. (See fig. 6).\nOther Design Choices. According to Design Excellence building  managers that responded to our survey and at locations we visited, the  effect of several other design choices including energy efficient elements  (e.g., solar panels and green roofs), courtyards, floors, and circulation  (e.g., hallways, stairways, and elevators) increased O&M costs. For  example, according to these officials, (1) the design of green roofs led to  water leaks; (2) the design of courtyards led to problems maintaining  unique landscaping; (3) flooring choices, specifically selected materials,  led to premature scuffing and cracking; and (4) the design of hallways  and stairways made them difficult to maintain.\n\n\tGSA Does Not Fully Consider O&M and Functionality Effects When Making Design Choices\n\nWith the Design Excellence Program, GSA aims to create buildings that  are cost-effective and function well for tenants. However, GSA makes  design choices for Design Excellence buildings during the planning and  design stages of new projects without fully considering the effect of these  choices on O&M costs and functionality.\n\n\t\tGSA Does Not Fully Consider How Design Choices Affect O&M Costs\n\nGSA does not estimate most O&M costs during planning and design.  Specifically, according to GSA officials we interviewed and planning  documents we reviewed, when planning and designing new buildings,  officials estimate the costs of major energy systems, such as boilers and  chillers. However, based on our review of GSA and industry data, these  systems only account for about one-third of O&M costs in Design  Excellence buildings. GSA officials stated that they do not estimate the  remaining two-thirds of O&M costs\u2014which include maintenance,  cleaning, and landscaping\u2014until late in the building\u2019s construction.  However, GSA officials also said that it would be costly to make  significant design changes at that point in the process. In addition, the  O&M estimates for maintenance, cleaning, and landscaping are for the  purpose of selecting a contractor to provide these services, not as a  means for addressing or reducing future O&M costs, according to  officials.\nGSA building and regional managers who are responsible for addressing  the O&M consequences of design choices told us that they were not  always integrated or asked to participate in planning and designing new  Design Excellence buildings. Specifically, GSA building and regional  managers at several of the buildings we visited stated that they were  never, or seldom, consulted on O&M costs and issues during the design  process, nor did they have an opportunity to review design documents. A  few GSA building managers we spoke with stated that on rare occasions  when they were consulted their input was rarely incorporated, or was  requested too late in the construction stage to allow for necessary  changes. According to these officials, if given the chance, they could have  highlighted issues with certain design choices that would significantly  increase O&M costs and could have offered potential solutions to reduce  those costs. Officials responsible for overseeing the Design Excellence  Program told us that other officials with an understanding of issues  surrounding O&M are involved in the process for designing new buildings  through, for example, subject matter reviews of the design concepts.  Officials agreed, however, that more could be done to formally involve the  perspective of facilities staff, such as building managers, who are  responsible for the day-to-day management of O&M.\nWe found that GSA\u2019s lack of consideration of how design choices may  affect the O&M costs of Design Excellence buildings could be attributed  to existing procedures that do not emphasize the need to consider such  costs during the planning and design stage. Specifically, GSA\u2019s  procedures for planning, designing, and constructing new Design  Excellence buildings focus on design creativity, construction challenges,  budget, and schedule and do not direct GSA to estimate O&M costs  during planning and design. While these procedures promote several  factors to consider in a building\u2019s design\u2014including aesthetics,  functionality, and constructability\u2014and generally require firms to submit  documentation on budget and schedule, they do not call for information  on expected O&M costs. In addition, these procedures do not include  seeking input on design decisions from facilities personnel who will have  responsibility for the ongoing O&M once the building is occupied.\nFederal standards for internal control state that federal agencies should  use complete and relevant information when making decisions and  design control activities, including procedures, to achieve objectives.  These federal standards also state that federal agencies should ensure  the communication of information internally, for example through  procedures that allow management to receive quality information from  personnel, to help achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. In addition, guidance  from GSA and the Office of Management and Budget directs officials to  consider and strive for the lowest possible costs, including O&M costs,  when designing buildings.\nInformation on how specific design choices could affect ongoing O&M  costs would allow GSA to better understand the impact of those choices.  Such information is critical as O&M accounts for a significant proportion of  resources dedicated to federal buildings over the long-term. According to  GSA and industry associations, O&M costs are significantly higher over  time than all other costs, including for construction, and typically account  for between 60 and 80 percent of building lifecycle costs. To illustrate  this point, we analyzed GSA construction and O&M data for Design  Excellence buildings. As figure 7 shows, we estimate that over an  average building\u2019s age (60 years) the total construction and O&M costs  for GSA\u2019s 78 existing Design Excellence buildings could be about $18  billion\u2014$8.1 billion for construction (45 percent) and $9.9 billion for O&M  (55 percent). Because GSA\u2019s procedures do not direct officials to  estimate about two-thirds of O&M costs or fully integrate officials with an  understanding of the O&M consequences of design decisions, officials  may not have been aware of how design choices would affect  approximately $6.6 billion (two-thirds of $9.9 billion) in O&M costs. In  addition, without procedures that clearly emphasize the need to more fully  consider O&M costs in Design Excellence buildings during the planning  and design stage, GSA and other stakeholders may not have a complete  picture of all relevant information necessary to make informed decisions  on how to best design future federal buildings.\nGSA realizes that the focus of Design Excellence projects has been on  design and construction, not O&M costs, and, in September 2017,  initiated a process, called \u201cOperational Excellence\u201d, to more fully consider  O&M costs. This process includes considering ways to more fully  consider O&M costs during planning and design, including developing a  cost tool that would estimate future O&M costs. In addition, GSA is  considering ways to update existing procedures for designing and  constructing new buildings to include a more comprehensive evaluation of  potential O&M costs, for example, by more fully integrating  knowledgeable personnel at key stages. However, according to GSA  officials, they are still in the early stages of determining what needs to be  done in part due to a small staff, which includes one full-time employee  and one part-time employee. As of March 2018, GSA has not established  a schedule for updating its procedures to require considering O&M during  design.\n\n\t\tDesign Excellence Buildings Generally Function Well, but Some Costly Design Choices Did Not Improve Functionality\n\nMost design choices made for Design Excellence buildings, including the  shape and size of courtrooms and the lighting in hallways, have had a  positive effect on overall building functionality (i.e., helped the tenant  agency achieve its mission), according to officials we surveyed and  interviewed. For example, GSA building managers we surveyed reported  the functionality of at least one design choice in most buildings (72 of 78  buildings) as good or very good. Specifically, they reported that in most  buildings, the overall functionality of design choices was good in many of  the areas we asked them about. In addition, building managers reported  that the functionality of the following design choices was also good or  very good:  selected material color (53 buildings) and lighting (58 buildings);  shape and size of the space (61 buildings); pedestrian circulation (61 buildings); and  temperature control in the areas critical for a building\u2019s operation,  such as courtrooms or office space (46 buildings).\nGSA and tenant agency officials whom we interviewed were also positive  about how the design choices affected the functionality of their buildings,  especially the use of windows and atriums to allow natural light. Tenants  also reported they enjoyed other features of the new buildings, including  commissioned artwork and the design of the interior and exterior.  Tenants\u2019 satisfaction with the function of Design Excellence buildings  may, in part, reflect the condition of their previous office space. For  example, one tenant noted that moving from temporary trailers into a  state-of-the-art courthouse was a substantial functional improvement.\nHowever, we found that increased spending on certain design choices did  not always provide improved functionality for the building tenant. For  example, GSA building managers reported that in many buildings (67 of  78) atriums and lobbies (i.e., vertical penetrations) have increased O&M  costs due to higher repair, cleaning, and energy costs. At the same time,  building managers reported that in 51 of those 67 buildings, choices  made in the design of multistory atriums and lobbies, e.g., material color  and lighting, did not have a positive effect on building functionality (see  table 2). Similarly, the decision to install solar panels and green roofs  (e.g., energy efficient elements), increased O&M costs in several areas,  particularly repair costs, but in over half of the buildings with these  features, building managers did not report an improvement in  functionality. For example, in two courthouses we visited solar panels  installed with the intention of saving on energy costs are not supplying as  much power as expected and, therefore, have not yet provided the  expected energy benefits.\nTenants we interviewed also noted that in some cases, design choices  have not functioned well and are costly to maintain and operate.  According to a tenant at one Design Excellence office building, while the  decision to construct a multistory atrium has added aesthetic value for  federal employees, it has also resulted in challenges balancing air  pressure between the atrium and the adjacent office spaces. These  differences in air pressure have resulted in uncomfortable working  conditions, such as fluctuating temperatures, which have hampered  productivity. Another tenant told us about design choices such as long  hallways and elevators that do not stop at all floors, making it difficult for  tenant employees to move efficiently through the building. Some of these  design choices, such as elevators with mechanical systems at the bottom  of the elevator shaft, have proven costly to maintain as they age more  quickly. Other tenants noted that the selection of heating and cooling  systems, which automatically adjust building temperatures based on time  of day, for example, have not functioned as planned, resulting in variable  temperatures and employee discomfort.\nIn addition, GSA has sometimes made design choices in buildings that do  not apply to one of the primary functional goals of the Design Excellence  Program\u2014to serve as a landmark that positively represents the federal  government to the public. Specifically, GSA does not consider that some  buildings, due to their purpose or location, are unlikely to function as  landmarks because they have limited interaction with or limited visibility  by the public. In this regard, we found that most Design Excellence  buildings (66 of 78) are visible and accessible to the general public, i.e.,  \u201cpublic-facing\u201d. Many of these buildings have succeeded in becoming  public landmarks and several have won awards for their design.  Specifically,\n62 serve as courthouses, which are visible from public streets and  people may enter to observe judicial proceedings or conduct personal  business. See figure 8 for an example of a Design Excellence  courthouse with publicly visible exteriors and interiors.\nFour serve as office buildings for various federal agencies that are  publicly accessible.\nIn contrast, we found that 12 Design Excellence office buildings restrict  the public from accessing interior spaces. Specifically,\nSeven can be seen from public sidewalks or roads, even though the  building is not open to the public, such as the U.S. Secret Service  Headquarters and FBI field office buildings. As a result, these  buildings\u2019 exteriors could be public landmarks that represent the  federal government, but the interior design features are not publicly  accessible. For example, the Ronald H. Brown U.S. Mission to the  United Nations Building in New York City has an impressive and  publicly visible exterior fa\u00e7ade but restricts public access to a multi- story rotunda and art space (see fig. 9).\nFive have obstructed views from public roads and sidewalks in  addition to restricting public access to the interior. Neither the  exterior nor interior design choices, which can be expensive to  operate and maintain, in these buildings can be seen or appreciated  by the public. For example, according to the tenant agency and GSA  officials, the visually impressive interior atrium and courtyard at the  Ariel Rios Federal Building have proven logistically challenging and  expensive to maintain and are not accessible to the public. In addition, the fa\u00e7ade of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  Satellite Operations Facility, which, according to GSA officials, is  expensive to maintain and repair, is not accessible by the public. (See  fig. 10).\nAccording to GSA officials, when they carry out their planning and design  for Design Excellence buildings, they do not differentiate between  buildings that will be public-facing and those that will not. This approach  may be in part due to the fact that GSA\u2019s procedures for planning and  designing new Design Excellence buildings do not call for consideration  of how design choices may have different functional benefits, including  whether the interior and exterior of planned buildings would be accessible  to the public. Federal standards for internal control state that federal  agencies should use complete and relevant information when making  decisions and designing control activities, including procedures to achieve  objectives. By taking a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach and not considering  the functionality of design choices, such as how a building\u2019s location and  intended use will affect the public\u2019s ability to see the exterior and interior,  GSA may be selecting design choices that increase O&M costs without  improving functionality.\n\n\tGSA Does Not Systematically Collect and Share Information on Common O&M Cost Experiences That Could Affect Design Choices\n\nAccording to GSA officials, GSA currently does not systematically collect  and share information on how design choices made for previous Design  Excellence projects have affected O&M costs with the project teams\u2014 consisting of a project manager, contracting officer, and other GSA  officials\u2014that are responsible for overseeing the planning and design of  new buildings. GSA has evaluated what is and is not working effectively  in some existing Design Excellence buildings and has on occasion shared  these evaluations with project teams. For example, GSA has evaluated  the performance of 6 out of 78 Design Excellence buildings. These  evaluations included identifying design decisions that led to higher O&M  costs and, on one occasion, developed a formal presentation to share  these lessons with the team working on a new Design Excellence project.\nAccording to officials, GSA requires agency personnel with subject matter  expertise to review building design concepts provided by private-sector  architects and engineers. GSA also fosters information sharing through  procedures that encourage project teams to exchange ideas, lessons  learned, and concerns. However, these processes either (1) are not done  in a consistent or systematic way, or (2) require information sharing  among a small group of officials, i.e., a project team, which might not  have visibility over the extensive design choices made in all existing  buildings. While all of these information-sharing initiatives offer benefits,  GSA\u2019s procedures do not include a systematic collection and sharing of  information with the project teams responsible for managing new Design  Excellence projects on how design choices affected O&M costs in  existing Design Excellence buildings. According to GSA officials, they are  considering formalizing this sort of information collection and sharing as  part of the Operational Excellence process, but as previously noted, GSA  is in the early stages of setting up this initiative and has not established a  schedule for completing its actions or updating its procedures.\nAs discussed, some design choices in existing Design Excellence  buildings have decreased or increased O&M costs. Since GSA does not  systematically share how these types of design choices affected O&M  costs with teams responsible for planning and designing new buildings,  similar issues could occur in future buildings. For example, we previously  mentioned that building managers indicated that using durable materials,  low maintenance landscaping, and energy-efficient lighting can reduce  long-term O&M costs.\nBuilding managers also reported common issues caused by design  choices that led to increased costs including:  Inefficiently located mechanical systems. Building managers reported  the location of mechanical systems in Design Excellence buildings  often led to increased cost. Specifically, building managers reported  the location of these systems increased repair costs (41 out of 77  buildings) and energy costs (32 out of 77 buildings). In the Design  Excellence buildings we visited, building managers and tenants  reported issues with the location of mechanical systems (4 buildings).  For example, officials indicated that air-conditioning systems were  placed in inefficient locations that required more energy usage  because water had to be pumped unnecessarily far distances (see fig.  11).\nDifficult-to-access lights. Building managers reported that design  choices for the location of interior lights increased maintenance costs  in the majority of Design Excellence buildings (55). In particular,  managers reported that the location of lights in atriums and lobbies  (38 buildings) and courtrooms and other mission spaces (33  buildings) increased costs. In addition, GSA officials at locations we  visited said that lights above tall staircases, ceiling lights in atriums  and auditoriums, and lights directly above permanent structures led to  additional costs, including the need to use scaffolding or rent large  equipment to maintain these lights. (See fig. 12). One way that a  majority of GSA building managers (61) we surveyed are attempting  to mitigate high maintenance cost for lighting issues is to install  energy efficient equipment, such as light-emitting diode (LED) lights.\nDifficult-to-maintain materials and finishes. In 68 Design Excellence  buildings, building managers reported that materials or finishes were  chosen that are easily worn. Similarly, in buildings we visited (4  buildings), GSA officials reported that decisions on the materials used  or configuration of exterior surfaces (e.g., the roof or fa\u00e7ade) of a  Design Excellence building led to repair and maintenance problems,  particularly water leaks. (See fig. 13).\nHard to clean surfaces. Cleaning surfaces, especially in atriums, can  be a challenge for maintaining Design Excellence buildings. For  example, building managers we surveyed reported that the decision to  install certain types of window treatments increased cleaning costs  (49 buildings). In three buildings we visited, building managers and  tenants also said Design Excellence buildings required special  equipment or scaffolding to clean windows or surfaces, which led to  increased cleaning costs. (See fig. 14).\nAccording to federal standards for internal control, agencies should use  and communicate complete and relevant information when designing  control activities, including procedures to achieve objectives. Without a  formalized process for systematically collecting and sharing how design  choices affected O&M costs in existing buildings, designs for future  Design Excellence buildings may not benefit from the successful  strategies used by others to reduce O&M costs or may continue to repeat  problematic choices that may result in increased O&M costs.\n\n\tConclusions\n\nThrough the Design Excellence Program, GSA has achieved excellence  in architecture and the design of federal buildings. Buildings constructed  under the Design Excellence Program have created unique and  aesthetically pleasing workspaces, have met the functional needs of  tenant agencies, and have become public landmarks. However, because  GSA does not have program procedures that call for consideration of how  certain design features may affect O&M, it may not be fully aware of the  costs of including these features in its building design and plans.  Specifically, GSA does not estimate or gather all perspectives from  building and regional managers on the full O&M costs of design choices,  or consider the extent to which they will improve the functionality of the  building for tenants and the public. For example, GSA\u2019s one-size fits all  approach in designing these buildings does not consider whether non- public buildings need the same costly architectural elements as buildings  intended to serve as public landmarks. Further, GSA is missing  opportunities to improve future building designs by not systematically  gathering and sharing information on the common design choices that  had both positive and negative effects on O&M costs. Without a clear  picture of the ongoing costs of these choices, GSA and other  stakeholders are missing critical information to better inform the design  and construction of new buildings. While GSA has just begun an  Operational Excellence initiative to help identify future O&M costs, it is not  clear what actions GSA will take to improve consideration of O&M costs  during planning and design or when it will take those actions.\n\n\tRecommendations for Executive Action\n\nWe are making the following four recommendations to GSA:\nThe Administrator of the General Services Administration should  update existing procedures to require GSA officials to estimate the full  operations and maintenance costs of design choices in the planning  and design process for new Design Excellence buildings.  (Recommendation 1)\nThe Administrator of the General Services Administration should  update existing procedures to require GSA officials to obtain  information from personnel responsible for addressing the operations  and maintenance consequences of design choices at key decision  points during the planning and design of new Design Excellence  buildings. (Recommendation 2)\nThe Administrator of the General Services Administration should  update existing procedures to require GSA officials to further consider  and document, during the planning and design of new Design  Excellence buildings, how design choices may affect building  functionality, such as whether a building is publicly visible and  accessible. (Recommendation 3)\nThe Administrator of the General Services Administration should  update existing procedures to require GSA officials to systematically  collect and share information with project teams responsible for  overseeing the planning and design of new buildings on the positive  and negative effects of common design choices on operations and  maintenance costs in existing Design Excellence buildings.  (Recommendation 4)\n\n\tAgency Comments\n\nWe provided a draft of this report to GSA, the U.S. Administrative Office  of Courts, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of  Justice, and the Department of Commerce for comment. In written  comments, reproduced in appendix IV, GSA stated that it agreed with our  recommendations and provided several technical comments. GSA  clarified its policies for selecting and analyzing the lifecycle costs of  building systems. In addition, GSA stated that table 2 in our report did not  capture the full functional benefits and reasons for making certain design  choices. As we noted in the report, this table does not preclude that a  specific design choice may be functional or have functional benefits. We  also included several of the examples GSA highlighted in their comments,  such as the functional need for a separate structure, which may serve key  security functions. GSA also stated that our conclusions did not indicate  that most Design Excellence buildings functioned well. We added  language to the conclusions to clarify this point.\nThe U.S. Administrative Office of Courts, the Department of Homeland  Security, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Commerce  did not provide comments.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Administrator of the General Services Administration,  Director of the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, Attorney General, and  the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Commerce. In addition, the  report is available at no charge on the GAO website at  http://www.gao.gov.\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-2834 or rectanusl@gao.gov.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this  report are listed in appendix V.\n\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\n\nThis report assesses the extent to which: (1) the General Services  Administration (GSA) made design choices that affect operations and  maintenance (O&M) costs; (2) GSA considers O&M costs and  functionality when planning and designing buildings; and (3) GSA  systematically collects and shares information on O&M costs related to  design choices in existing buildings.\nTo address all of our objectives, we reviewed applicable federal  regulations; GSA procedures, policies, and standards for designing,  constructing, and operating federal facilities, including specific policies  and procedures for Design Excellence buildings; our prior work; and  reports by other federal agencies and related professional organizations  on topics, including the standard costs of operating and maintaining office  buildings. Our review examined 78 federal buildings and courthouses that  GSA constructed under the Design Excellence Program\u2014referred to as  \u201cDesign Excellence buildings\u201d\u2014since the program started in 1994. At our  request, GSA provided a list of all buildings under the agency\u2019s custody  and control that were constructed under the Design Excellence Program.  Based on input from GSA officials indicating that large campuses were  unlikely to have reliable O&M data, we excluded nine buildings that are  part of the White Oak Campus in Silver Spring, Maryland. We reviewed  relevant GSA documents pertaining to the remaining 78 Design  Excellence buildings, including the most recent Asset Business Plans  detailing investment needs for maintenance and repairs, strategies for  efficient operations, building use, and tenant satisfaction. We analyzed  GSA-provided historical data on construction and O&M costs from 2000  to 2016 for the buildings in our review and projected O&M future costs. To  calculate our projection, we made several assumptions, including (1) that  annual O&M costs would increase at the same level as 2016 O&M costs  ($174 million), and (2) that Design Excellence buildings will reach the  average age of all current GSA buildings (60 years). We assessed the  reliability of these data through electronic testing and reviewing documentation on the data. We determined that the data provided were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of illustrating the extent to which O&M  costs make up total building costs.\nWe also conducted a web-based survey of GSA building managers  responsible for overseeing O&M for the 78 Design Excellence buildings  included in our review. The survey addressed the extent to which certain  design choices affect O&M costs and building functionality. We developed  the survey based on our objectives, prior GAO work, and site visits to 10  Design Excellence buildings. We pretested the survey with GSA officials  at three Design Excellence buildings, which were selected based on  building age, location, total square feet, fiscal year 2016 O&M costs, and  the building\u2019s primary use (e.g., office or courthouse). As part of our  pretesting, we asked GSA building managers to explain their  understanding of survey questions and made edits based on their  comments. We conducted the survey from November 2017 to March  2018 and our response rate was 100 percent (78 out of 78). See  appendix III for a copy of the survey and summarized responses.\nWe visited 10 Design Excellence buildings in three GSA regions to view  design choices and O&M activities. As part of these site visits, we  conducted interviews that included tenant agencies located in these  buildings, GSA building managers responsible for managing these  buildings and officials from GSA regional offices with oversight  responsibilities for these buildings. To select our site visit locations and  ensure geographic and agency diversity, we considered several factors  including building operating costs, size, location, and the tenant agency.  Based on these criteria we selected the buildings listed in table 3. The  interviews and tours we conducted during our site visits do not allow us to  generalize the findings to all Design Excellence buildings. Information  gathered from our site visits did allow us to show how O&M costs were  considered in specific Design Excellence buildings and the effects of  design choices.\nWe also interviewed GSA officials located in GSA Headquarters within  the Office of Design and Construction, including the Chief Architect, and  the Office of Facilities Management. We also interviewed GSA regional  officials within the Office of Facilities Management in four of GSA\u2019s 11  regional offices: Greater Southwest Region, National Capital Region,  Pacific Rim Region, and Southeast Sunbelt Region. We selected regional  offices based on the location of our site visits and included one additional  regional office based on it having the highest total O&M operating costs of  the eight remaining regional offices. We discussed several topics with  GSA officials, including how O&M costs were considered during planning  and design and how information on the O&M costs of design choices are  shared.\nTo determine the extent to which GSA considers O&M costs and  functionality when planning and designing buildings, we analyzed Federal  Real Property Profile (FRPP) data. Our analysis of U.S. government- owned office buildings that are less than 40 years old, occupied, and  needed for a tenant\u2019s mission, identified five potentially relevant variables  to explain variation in the O&M costs: building type (i.e., whether a  building was constructed under the Design Excellence Program), size,  age, and condition of the building, as well as the median hourly wage of  O&M services in the building\u2019s location. After controlling for these  variables, we found that size and median hourly wage but not building  type had a statistically significant relationship to O&M costs. We  assessed the reliability of these data through electronic testing as well as  a review of documentation for each federal data source. We determined  that the data provided were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  describing our attempts to identify factors that influence O&M costs in  federal buildings. We also requested and received additional information  from the building managers of Design Excellence federal office buildings.  Specifically we asked for information on the extent to which these federal  office buildings are public-facing, have restrictions on public entry and are  visible from public sidewalks or roads, and what the daily volume of public  visitors was.\nWe compared GSA\u2019s efforts to consider O&M costs in the planning and  design of Design Excellence buildings to pertinent Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government on using complete and relevant  information when making decisions and design control activities, including  procedures, to achieve objectives, as well as on communicating  information internally. In addition, we compared GSA\u2019s efforts to consider  these costs in the planning and design of Design Excellence buildings to  guidance from GSA and the Office of Management and Budget that  directs agency officials to consider and strive for the lowest possible  costs, including O&M costs, when designing buildings. We also  compared GSA\u2019s efforts to consider functionality when planning and  designing these buildings to pertinent Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government on using complete and relevant information when  making decisions and design control activities, including procedures, to  achieve objectives.\nTo assess the extent to which GSA systematically collects and shares  information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing Design  Excellence buildings, we reviewed Post Occupancy Evaluations  commissioned by GSA on six Design Excellence buildings. These  evaluations contain information, such as how GSA buildings are  performing and the extent to which they comply with GSA\u2019s federal  standards for public buildings. These evaluations can include reviews of  operations and maintenance documentation, interviews and surveys with  building occupants, and interviews with relevant GSA staff, architectural  and engineering design team staff, and an on-site evaluation. We also compared GSA\u2019s process for collecting and sharing how design choices  affected O&M costs in existing buildings to pertinent Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government on using and communicating  complete and relevant information when designing control activities,  including procedures, to achieve objectives.\nWe conducted this performance audit from May 2017 to May 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\n\nAppendix II: Buildings Constructed under the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Design Excellence Program\n\nGSA created the Design Excellence Program in 1994. Under this  program, GSA has constructed 78 buildings in 33 states and the District  of Columbia, buildings that range in size from about 35,000- to over 3- million gross square feet (see table 4).\n\nAppendix III: Survey of General Services Administration (GSA) Building Managers and Summarized Results\n\n\tThis appendix provides a copy of the survey completed by managers for all 78 buildings constructed under GSA\u2019s Design Excellence Program included in our review. The appendix also includes the responses received for each of the close- ended questions (1a, 1b, 1c, 1e, 2a, 3a, and 4a); it does not include information on open-ended responses (1d, 1f, 2b, 3b, 3c, 4b, and 5). The purpose of this survey was to gather responses on how design choices affected operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and building function. See appendix I for additional information on our survey methodology.\n\nAppendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\n\n\tGAO Contact\n\nLori Rectanus, (202) 512-2834 or rectanusl@gao.gov.\n\n\tStaff Acknowledgments\n\nIn addition to the contact named above, Keith Cunningham (Assistant  Director); Matthew Cook (Analyst in Charge); Eli Albagli; Sarah Arnett;  Colin Ashwood; Melissa Bodeau; Lacey Coppage; Caitlin Cusati;  Terrence Lam; Joshua Ormond; Dae Park; Minette Richardson; Kelly  Rubin; Ardith Spence; and Dave Wise made key contributions to this  report.\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "Why GAO Did This Study\n\nSince 1994, GSA has spent more than $8 billion to construct 78 new federal buildings through its Design Excellence program. Some design choices can affect a building's O&M costs and functionality.\nGAO was asked to review GSA's ability to manage O&M costs under the Design Excellence program. This report assesses the extent to which: (1) GSA's design choices affect O&M costs; (2) GSA considers O&M costs and functionality when planning and designing buildings; and (3) GSA systematically collects and shares information on O&M costs.\nGAO conducted a web-based survey of building managers for the 78 Design Excellence buildings. GAO also visited 10 Design Excellence buildings in three GSA regions selected based on several factors, including geographic and agency diversity. GAO reviewed GSA documents, and interviewed GSA officials and building tenants. Information obtained through site visits and interviews is not generalizable.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nThe goals of the General Services Administration's (GSA) Design Excellence Program are to creatively design federal buildings that meet federal agencies' functional needs and become public landmarks. Some design choices for Design Excellence buildings have decreased ongoing operations and maintenance (O&M) costs, but others have increased those costs. GSA's building managers and tenants told GAO that design choices that have reduced O&M costs include the use of durable materials and low maintenance landscaping. Other design choices have increased O&M costs. For example, according to GAO's survey of 78 building managers of Design Excellence buildings, multistory atriums often led to additional O&M costs, including the need to erect expensive scaffolding for maintenance.\nWhile GSA aims to create Design Excellence buildings that are cost-effective and functional, it makes design choices without fully considering their effect on O&M costs and functionality. For example, GSA officials do not estimate the majority of O&M costs, such as the building maintenance associated with their design choices until the design is almost finalized. This outcome is partly because GSA procedures do not direct GSA officials to develop such estimates during the design and planning of Design Excellence buildings and because building and regional managers responsible for addressing the O&M consequences are also not involved in the design and planning process. As a result, important cost information that could help building project teams make the most cost-effective design choices is not available to help them. In addition, while building managers GAO surveyed reported that GSA's design choices generally support a building's functionality, they also reported that some design choices increased O&M costs without improving functionality. For example, they identified design choices related to material color and lighting that increased O&M costs but did not enhance the functionality of the building for the tenants.\nAlthough GSA has developed some information on how design choices can affect O&M costs, it does not consistently collect and share such information. For example, GSA has evaluated the performance of only six Design Excellence buildings, and does not systematically collect information on how design choices have affected O&M costs in all existing buildings. Without a process to collect and share such information, future buildings may not benefit from these lessons, and problematic choices may be repeated.\n\nWhat GAO Recommends\n\nGAO is making four recommendations to update existing GSA procedures for planning and designing new buildings to: (1) estimate full O&M costs; (2) obtain information from personnel responsible for addressing the O&M consequences of design decisions; (3) further consider how design choices may affect building functionality; and (4) systematically collect and share lessons from existing buildings. GSA agreed with these recommendations.",

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nLaw Enforcement Agencies Reported Various Uses and Benefits from the Transfer of the DOD Excess Controlled Property\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies and state coordinators in our survey\u2014 as well as officials we interviewed from federal, state, and local law  enforcement agencies\u2014reported various uses of DOD excess controlled  property for law enforcement activities. The reported uses included  enhancing counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security activities.  Also, law enforcement agencies reported using DOD\u2019s excess controlled  property for other law enforcement activities, such as search and rescue,  natural disaster response, surveillance, reaching barricaded suspects,  police training, and the serving of warrants.\nFederal, state, and local agencies cited a number of ways in which they  had benefited from LESO program, with several reporting that the  transfers of controlled property allowed them to save money. For  example, a local law enforcement official in Texas reported that 96  percent of the department budget goes to salaries and that the LESO  program helped the department acquire items that it would otherwise not  be able to afford, saving the department an estimated $2 million to $3  million. Additionally, agencies provided examples of how property they  received through the LESO program have been used. For example, the  Bureau of Indian Affairs officials reported they have used vehicles to  support their Office of Justice Services\u2019 drug unit during marijuana  eradication and border operations by providing transport to agents over  inhospitable terrain in mountainous and desert environments. In another  example, Texas law enforcement officials reported that the San Marcos  and Hays County police departments used their issued Mine Resistant  Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to rescue more than 600 stranded  people from floodwaters in October 2015. Moreover, the Los Angeles  County Sheriff\u2019s Department reported that it used a robot to remove a rifle  from an attempted murder suspect who had barricaded himself.\n\n\tDLA Has Taken Some Actions to Address Weaknesses in Its Excess Controlled Property Program, but Deficiencies Exist in Key Processes\n\n\t\tDLA Actions to Address Weaknesses in LESO Program\n\nDLA has taken some steps to address previously identified weaknesses  in its processes for transferring and monitoring its excess controlled  property through revisions to its policy and procedures on the  management, oversight, and accountability of the LESO program. Such  revisions were made, in part, because of recommendations made by the  DOD and DLA Offices of Inspector General. The DOD and DLA Offices of  Inspector General conducted four audits of the LESO program between  2003 and 2013 that identified more than a dozen recommendations, such  as developing and implementing written standard operating procedures  for the approval and disapproval of law enforcement agency property  requests and issuance, transfer, turn-in and disposal of LESO property. In  our July 2017 report, we found the department had taken the following  actions to enhance its transfer process through revisions to policy and  procedures:  transitioned full management responsibility of the LESO Program to DLA Disposition Services in 2009; developed LESO Program Standard Operating Procedures in 2012 and updated them in 2013; transitioned to a new data system in 2013 after identifying that the old system was not capable of post-issue tracking;revised the DLA instruction that provides policy, responsibility, and procedures for DLA\u2019s management responsibilities of the LESO program in 2014 and 2016; and revised LESO program processes in 2016 to incorporate recommendations made by the Federal Interagency Law Enforcement Equipment Working Group, such as defining executive order controlled property or prohibiting schools K-12 from participating in the program.\nIn addition, DLA is in the process of developing additional training on  LESO program policies and procedures, and is establishing  memorandums of understanding with federal law enforcement agencies  on the general terms and conditions of participating in the program,  including the restrictions on the transfer and sale of controlled property.\n\n\t\tDLA Has Deficiencies in Its Processes for Verifying and Approving Applications and Transferring Property and Has Not Conducted a Risk Assessment\n\nWe found weaknesses in three areas: (1) verifying and approving  applications, (2) transferring property, and (3) the assessment of risk.  First, our independent testing of the LESO program\u2019s internal controls  identified deficiencies in the processes for verification and approval of  federal law enforcement agency applications. Specifically, our  investigators posing as authorized federal law enforcement officials of a  fictitious agency applied and were granted access to the LESO program  in early 2017. In late 2016, we emailed our completed application to the  LESO program office. Our application contained fictitious information  including agency name, number of employees, point of contact, and  physical location. In early 2017, after revising our application at the  direction of LESO officials we were notified that our fictitious law  enforcement agency was approved to participate in the LESO program.  LESO officials also emailed us to request confirmation of our agency\u2019s  authorizing statute; in response, our investigators submitted fictitious  authorizing provisions as provisions in the U.S. Code. At no point during  the application process did LESO officials verbally contact officials at the  agency we created\u2014either the main point of contact listed on the  application or the designated point of contact at a headquarters\u2019 level\u2014to  verify the legitimacy of our application or to discuss establishing a  memorandum of understanding with our agency.\nDLA\u2019s internal controls for verifying and approving federal agency  applications and enrollment in the LESO program were not adequate to  prevent the approval of a fraudulent application to obtain excess  controlled property. Specifically, LESO\u2019s reliance on electronic  communications without actual verification does not allow it to properly  vet for potentially fraudulent activity. For example, DLA did not require  supervisory approval for all federal agency applications, or require  confirmation of the application with designated points of contact at the  headquarters of participating federal agencies. Additionally, at the time  we submitted our application, DLA officials did not visit the location of the  applying federal law enforcement agency to help verify the legitimacy of  the application. After our briefing of DLA officials in March 2017 on the  results of our investigative work, DLA officials stated they took immediate  action, and in April 2017 visited 13 participating federal law enforcement  agencies. However, at this time DLA has not reviewed and revised the  policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency  applications and enrollment in the LESO program.\nSecond, our independent testing also identified deficiencies in the transfer  of controlled property, such as DLA personnel not routinely requesting  and verifying identification of individuals picking up controlled property or  verifying the quantity of approved items prior to transfer. Our  investigators, after being approved to participate in the LESO program,  obtained access to the department\u2019s online systems to view and request  controlled property. We subsequently submitted requests to obtain  controlled property, including non-lethal items and potentially-lethal items  if modified with commercially available items. In less than a week after  submitting the requests, our fictitious agency was approved for the  transfer of over 100 controlled property items with a total estimated value  of about $1.2 million. The estimated value of each item ranged from $277  to over $600,000, including items such as night-vision goggles, reflex  (also known as reflector) sights, infrared illuminators, simulated pipe  bombs, and simulated rifles. Our investigator scheduled appointments  and obtained the controlled property items, such as those shown in the  photos below.\nUsing fictitious identification and law enforcement credentials, along with  the LESO-approved documentation, our investigator was able to pass  security checks and enter the DLA Disposition Service warehouse sites.  Personnel at two of the three sites did not request or check for valid  identification of our investigator picking up the property. According to DLA  guidance, direct pickup of allocated property may be made by an  individual with valid identification and the appropriate DOD authorization  form that is signed by the authorized individual listed in the letter.\nDLA has not taken steps to reasonably ensure that onsite officials  routinely request and verify valid identification of the individual(s)  authorized to pick up allocated property from the LESO program, as  required by the guidance. DLA officials acknowledged they could take  additional steps to ensure compliance with the requirements in the  handbook. Furthermore, although we were approved to receive over 100  items and the transfer documentation reflects this amount, we were  provided more items than we were approved to receive. The discrepancy  involved one type of item\u2014infrared illuminators. We requested 48 infrared  illuminators but onsite officials at one Disposition Services site provided  us with 51 infrared illuminators in 52 pouches, of which one pouch was  empty. Additionally, we found that one DLA Disposition Services site had  a checklist as a part of their transfer documentation for their personnel to  complete. The checklist required manual completion of several items,  including quantity, date, and who fulfilled the order. The other two DLA  Disposition Services sites, including the site that transferred the wrong  quantity, did not include this checklist with the transfer documentation we  received. DLA guidance states that accountability records be maintained  in auditable condition to allow property to be traced from receipt to final  disposition. We concluded that without guidance that specifically  requires DLA Disposition Services\u2019 on-site officials to verify the type and  quantity of approved items against the actual items being transferred prior  to removal from the sites, DLA will lack reasonable assurance that the  approved items transferred are appropriately reflected in their inventory  records.\nThird, while DLA has taken some steps, mostly in early 2017, to address  identified deficiencies in the LESO program, DLA lacks a comprehensive  framework for instituting fraud prevention and mitigation measures.  During the course of our review, DLA revised the LESO program  applications by requiring applicants to sign an attestation that the agency  that they represent is a legitimate law enforcement agency. Further, DLA  officials stated they are more carefully reviewing the legitimacy of some  information on the application such as email addresses and physically  visiting federal agencies that enter into memorandums of understanding  with the LESO program.\nHowever, as previously discussed, we identified internal controls  weakness in the policy and procedures for verifying and approving federal  agency applications and enrollment as well as weakness throughout the  process from approval to the actual transfer of the items to the agencies,  which indicates that DLA has not examined potential risks for all stages of  the process. According to GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework, effective fraud  risk managers collect and analyze data on identified fraud schemes, use  these lessons learned to improve fraud risk management activities, and  plan and conduct fraud risk assessments that are tailored to their  programs. The framework states there is no universally accepted  approach for conducting fraud risk assessments since circumstances  among programs vary. However, per leading practices, assessing fraud  risks generally involves five actions: (1) identifying inherent fraud risks  affecting the program, (2) assessing the likelihood and effect of those  fraud risks, (3) determining fraud risk tolerance, (4) examining the  suitability of existing fraud controls and prioritizing residual fraud risks,  and (5) documenting the program\u2019s fraud risk profile.\nDLA has begun to examine some fraud risks associated with the LESO  program. However, DLA officials acknowledged during our March 2017  meeting that they have not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the  LESO program to include the application process, and as such, has not  designed or implemented a strategy with specific control activities to  mitigate risks to the program. We concluded that conducting such an  assessment could have program-wide improvements, including  strengthening the controls to verify the legitimacy of applicants.\nOverall, we concluded in our July 2017 report that DLA\u2019s internal controls  did not provide reasonable assurance in preventing fraud. Therefore, we  made four recommendations for DLA to:  review and revise policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment; ensure compliance that DLA Disposition Services on-site officials transferring controlled property verify that persons picking up items have valid identification and are authorized to pick up allocated property from the LESO program; issue guidance that requires DLA Disposition Services on-site officials to verify the type and quantity of approved items against the actual items being transferred prior to removal from the sites; and conduct a fraud risk assessment to design and implement a strategy with specific internal control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks.\nDOD concurred with all of our recommendations and highlighted actions  to address each one.\nChairman Wilson, Ranking Member Bordallo, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes our prepared statement. My colleague, Mr.  McElrath, and I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you  may have at this time.\n\n\tContacts and Acknowledgments\n\nFor questions about this statement, please contact Zina D.

    "output": "Why GAO Did This Study\n\nThis testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's July 2017 report, entitled DOD Excess Property: Enhanced Controls Needed for Access to Excess Controlled Property ( GAO-17-532 ).\nmerrittz@gao.gov or Wayne A. McElrath at (202) 512-2905 or mcelrathw@gao.gov .\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nThe Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has taken some actions and is planning additional actions to address identified weaknesses in its excess controlled property program. However, internal control deficiencies exist for, among other things, ensuring that only eligible applicants are approved to participate in the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) program and receive transfers of excess controlled property. DLA is establishing memorandums of understanding with participating federal agencies intended to, among other things, establish general terms and conditions for participation, revise its program application to require additional prospective participant information, and plans to provide additional online training for participating agencies that is expected to begin in late 2017. However, GAO created a fictitious federal agency to conduct independent testing of the LESO program's internal controls and DLA's transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies.\nThrough the testing, GAO gained access to the LESO program and obtained over 100 controlled items with an estimated value of $1.2 million, including night-vision goggles, simulated rifles, and simulated pipe bombs, which could be potentially lethal items if modified with commercially available items . GAO's testing identified that DLA has deficiencies in the processes for verification and approval of federal law enforcement agency applications and in the transfer of controlled property, such as DLA personnel not routinely requesting and verifying identification of individuals picking up controlled property or verifying the quantity of approved items prior to transfer. Further, GAO found that DLA has not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the LESO program, including the application process. Without strengthening DLA and LESO program internal controls over the approval and transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies, such as reviewing and revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, DLA lacks reasonable assurance that it has the ability to prevent, detect, and respond to potential fraud and minimize associated security risks.\nExamples of Controlled Property Items Obtained\nDLA maintains a public Internet site to address statutory requirements to provide information on all property transfers to law enforcement agencies. DLA's public Internet site shows all transferred property, and, as of April 2017, in response to GAO's findings, has included a definition of controlled property to distinguish for the general public what items are considered controlled.",

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBackground\n\n\t\tCFIUS Overview\n\nIn 1975, an executive order established CFIUS to monitor the impact of  and coordinate U.S. policy on foreign investment in the United States. In  1988, Congress enacted the Exon-Florio amendment adding section 721  to the Defense Production Act of 1950. The amendment authorized the  President to investigate the impact of certain foreign acquisitions of U.S.  companies on national security and to suspend or prohibit acquisitions  that might threaten to impair national security. FINSA further amended  the Defense Production Act, established CFIUS as it currently exists, and  guides the committee. One of the purposes of FINSA\u2019s enactment was to  ensure national security while promoting foreign investment and the  creation of U.S. jobs.\nCFIUS reviews transactions involving a large variety of countries and  industry sectors to determine if such transactions pose a threat to national  security and whether the transactions should be allowed to proceed (for  more information on the characteristics of transactions reviewed by  CFIUS, see app. II). FINSA does not formally define national security, but  provides a number of factors for CFIUS and the President to consider in  determining whether a transaction poses a risk. These factors include the  potential national security-related effects on U.S. critical technologies and  whether the transaction could result in the control of a U.S. business by a  foreign government. CFIUS also may consider other factors that it finds  appropriate in determining whether a transaction poses a national  security risk (for a full list of factors, see app. III).\nUnder FINSA, CFIUS is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and  includes voting members from the Departments of Commerce, Defense,  Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, and State; and the Offices of the  U.S. Trade Representative, and Science and Technology Policy. In  addition, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the  Department of Labor (DOL) are nonvoting ex officio members. Various  other White House offices also observe and, as appropriate, participate in  CFIUS activities (see fig. 1). CFIUS may also solicit perspectives and  expertise from nonmember agencies, such as the Department of  Agriculture, designating them as members for purposes of the review of  particular transactions, as appropriate, which can include negotiating or  imposing mitigation measures or referring the transaction to the President  for decision. The committee, which meets weekly at a staff level,  generally has three core functions: (1) review transactions that have been  submitted to the committee and take action as necessary to address any  national security concerns; (2) monitor and enforce compliance with  mitigation measures; and (3) identify transactions of concern that have  not been notified to CFIUS for review.\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, as the chair of CFIUS, is responsible for a  number of tasks. According to Department of the Treasury (Treasury)  officials, these tasks, including coordinating operations of the committee,  facilitating information collection from parties to a transaction, reviewing  and sharing data on mergers and acquisitions with member agencies,  and managing CFIUS timeframes, are carried out by Treasury employees  specifically staffed to support CFIUS. Treasury also communicates on the  committee\u2019s behalf with the parties, members of Congress, and the  general public. When necessary, Treasury is responsible for delivering  the committee\u2019s recommendation that the President should suspend or  prohibit a transaction.\n\n\t\tSelecting Transactions for CFIUS Review\n\nIn examining covered transactions, CFIUS members seek to identify and  address, as appropriate, any national security concerns that arise as a  result of the transaction. According to the FINSA amendment, a \u201ccovered\u201d  transaction is defined as any merger, acquisition, or takeover by or with  any foreign person that could result in foreign control of any person  engaged in interstate commerce in the United States. CFIUS reviews  \u201cnotices\u201d that have been submitted\u2014or notified\u2014to the committee by  parties to transactions. Notices to CFIUS contain information about the  nature of the transaction and the parties involved. According to guidance  on the Treasury website, with limited exceptions, a transaction receives  \u201csafe harbor\u201d when CFIUS has completed its review and determines that  the transaction may proceed. According to Treasury officials, safe harbor  provides the parties to the transaction some certainty that CFIUS and the  President will not subject the transaction to review again.\nFINSA does not require that parties notify CFIUS of a transaction;  however, CFIUS may choose to initiate a review of any covered  transaction. Transactions that have not been notified to CFIUS for  review are known as \u201cnon-notified transactions.\u201d According to member  agency officials, Treasury and several other member agencies have  processes for identifying non-notified transactions for CFIUS to potentially  review. For instance, Treasury staff compile data on mergers and  acquisitions and distribute information about potential non-notified  transactions to member agencies for review. In addition, according to  member agency officials, in 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) began a working group, now called Project Iceberg, which is  responsible for identifying and understanding counterintelligence threats  posed by foreign investments that have not been notified to CFIUS. The  working group holds monthly meetings that intelligence agencies as well  as CFIUS member agencies are invited to attend. In the absence of  voluntary reporting by the parties involved or independent discovery of  the transaction, it is possible that CFIUS may not review a covered  transaction that could pose a risk to national security.\n\n\t\tCFIUS Process for Reviewing Notified Transactions\n\nBased on information including FINSA and regulations, the CFIUS  process for reviewing transactions that have been notified to the  committee comprises up to four stages: pre-notice consultation, national  security review, national security investigation, and presidential action.  CFIUS reviews each transaction individually, with a focus on the aspects  of the transaction that could pose a risk. For each transaction reviewed,  the committee identifies agencies with relevant expertise to act as co-lead  with Treasury to guide the transaction through the CFIUS process.  CFIUS reviews are confidential and protected from public disclosure. A  CFIUS review could be concluded when CFIUS members reach  consensus about whether the transaction should be allowed to proceed,  including on the basis of mitigation, if necessary, or when the parties  withdraw their notice, whether for commercial reasons or in light of  CFIUS\u2019s national security concerns. Absent one of these conclusions to  a CFIUS review, the committee may send the transaction to the  President, with a recommendation that the President suspend or prohibit  it. See figure 2 for an overview of the steps that comprise the CFIUS  process for reviewing selected transactions.\nBefore a transaction is reviewed by CFIUS, Treasury may conduct a pre- notice consultation with parties to a notified transaction. Upon request,  Treasury and other agencies meet with the parties, provide informal  guidance on the CFIUS review process, and may review early drafts of  the notice.\nOnce the parties have developed the final draft, they submit it to the  committee for review. When Treasury, with input from member agencies,  determines that the notice of the transaction is complete, the official  CFIUS review of the transaction commences.\nCFIUS conducts a national security review of each notified transaction,  which includes determining whether it is a covered transaction and  developing a national security threat assessment. The national security  review lasts up to 30 days and begins the day after Treasury determines  the filing is complete and circulates the filing to CFIUS member agencies.  At the beginning of the national security review, CFIUS identifies co-lead  agencies. According to Treasury officials, typically within the first 10 to 12  days of the national security review, CFIUS develops a \u201ccovered  transaction analysis,\u201d which determines whether the transaction is a  covered transaction according to FINSA. According to Treasury officials,  there typically is consensus among voting members on whether the  transaction is a covered transaction. During the national security review,  CFIUS also assesses whether there is credible evidence that the foreign  party in control of that U.S. business might take action to impair the  national security of the United States as well as whether the covered  transaction is a foreign government-controlled transaction. Concurrently,  ODNI develops a national security threat assessment, with input and  support from the intelligence community, to be completed during the first  20 days of the national security review.\nIf CFIUS finds that the covered transaction does not present national  security risks or that other provisions of law provide adequate and  appropriate authority to address the risks, CFIUS may end its review. If  CFIUS chooses to conclude its review at this point, CFIUS is to advise  the parties in writing that the transaction has been cleared and allowed to  proceed. According to information provided by Treasury, CFIUS has  historically concluded action on the majority of transactions during or at  the end of the 30-day national security review. The committee\u2019s  determination must be certified to specified members of Congress after  the review is completed. However, if at the end of the national security  review, CFIUS has not yet determined that there are no unresolved  national security concerns and the committee requires additional time,  CFIUS may proceed to a national security investigation, which must be  completed within 45 days.\nIf, during the 45-day national security investigation, CFIUS identifies an  unresolved national security concern, it works with the parties to mitigate,  if appropriate, any national security risks that may exist. If an agency  identifies an unresolved national security concern, the agency develops  an analysis of the potential risks posed by the covered transaction and  includes recommendation for action, such as mitigation measures or  referral to the President, and shares this analysis with other members of  the committee. Mitigation measures may include ensuring that only  authorized persons have access to certain technologies, information, or  facilities, or providing the U.S. government the right to review certain  business decisions and to object if the decisions raise national security  concerns. According to Treasury officials, CFIUS member agencies aim  for mitigation that would be effective, can be monitored, and would be  enforceable. If there is a difference of opinion among CFIUS member  agencies about the level or type of mitigation that should be utilized,  CFIUS agencies discuss the matters to reach consensus.\nIn some cases, parties may choose to withdraw and resubmit the notice.  If CFIUS has determined that national security concerns cannot be  mitigated, according to Treasury officials, CFIUS typically advises the  parties that the committee will refer the matter to the President for  decision. According to Treasury officials, parties have the opportunity to  withdraw and resubmit the notice if they need additional time to discuss  CFIUS\u2019s concerns or to present additional information or mitigation  proposals for CFIUS\u2019s consideration. Sometimes parties choose to  withdraw and abandon the transaction if, for instance, CFIUS proposes  mitigation measures that the parties choose not to accept. Parties may  also abandon the transaction for commercial reasons unrelated to the  CFIUS review. If parties choose to withdraw and resubmit a transaction,  the national security review begins again, and the committee has another  75 days to complete the review of the transaction.\nIf CFIUS obtains consensus from committee members that there are no  unresolved national security concerns or the national security concerns  have been mitigated, the national security investigation ends, and the  covered transaction receives safe harbor. Treasury and the co-lead  agency send written certification to specified members of Congress that  there are no unresolved national security concerns. However, if the  committee concludes that a proposed foreign investment threatens to  impair the U.S. national security and the threat cannot be mitigated,  CFIUS will elevate the notice to the President for determination and  CFIUS may recommend that the President suspend or prohibit the  transaction. According to Treasury officials, parties may also withdraw  their notice at this point rather than have the President decide whether to  block the transaction.\nIf, at the end of the national security investigation, CFIUS elevates a  transaction to the President for determination, the President has 15 days  from the completed investigation to decide to prohibit or suspend the  acquisition, or to take no action. Only four transactions reviewed by  CFIUS have been the subject of a presidential prohibition since the  committee was established in 1975.\n\n\tStakeholders Have Concerns about the Increased CFIUS Workload but Treasury Has Not Coordinated Staffing Level Assessments\n\nCFIUS has experienced an increase in workload in recent years, but  Treasury, as CFIUS lead, has not coordinated member agency efforts to  better understand staffing levels needed to complete core committee  functions. According to CFIUS member agency officials, the volume of  transactions notified to the committee and the complexity of CFIUS  reviews in terms of technology, transaction structure, and national  security concerns have increased substantially from 2011 through 2016,  while CFIUS staffing levels have experienced a modest increase during  the same time period. Member agency officials stated that CFIUS is able  to review all transactions that have been voluntarily notified to the  committee. However, many stakeholders, including most member agency  officials and several external experts, expressed concerns that CFIUS  member agencies were limited in their ability to complete other CFIUS  functions, such as identifying non-notified transactions. In addition,  agency officials were unsure if they would have sufficient staff if the  CFIUS workload were to continue to increase. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government states that management should  establish the organizational structure necessary to achieve its objectives  and periodically evaluate this structure. Treasury has not coordinated  member agency efforts to better understand the staffing levels needed to  complete the current and future workload associated with core functions  of the committee.\n\n\t\tThe Volume of Covered Transactions CFIUS Reviewed Increased between 2011 and 2016\n\nDespite figures decreasing in one year, overall, the number of covered  transactions that CFIUS reported it reviewed increased from 111  transactions in 2011 to 172 transactions in 2016, or almost 55 percent  (see table 1). In 2017, CFIUS reviewed 238 transactions, according to  Treasury officials. According to member agency officials, the increased  volume of covered transactions resulted in increased work for all CFIUS  members, no matter which agency is the co-lead, because each member  agency must review each transaction notified to the committee.\nThe number of reported covered transactions requiring national security  investigations almost doubled during this same period, increasing from 40  transactions in 2011 to 79 transactions in 2016. Treasury officials told us  that they estimated that the total number of transactions that proceeded  to national security investigations was greater in 2017 than it was in  2016. They said that the increase in the number of covered transactions  that require a national security investigation is another indication that the  committee\u2019s workload has increased. One Treasury official noted that the  number of times that parties withdraw and resubmit transactions can  increase the workload of the committee as it must review the transaction  each time it is submitted.\nAdditionally, the number of reported covered transactions that include  mitigation measures has increased. Each year, CFIUS places mitigation  measures on a relatively small number of covered transactions. For  example, according to Treasury officials, 18 (roughly 10 percent) of 172  transactions the committee reviewed in 2016 resulted in mitigation  measures. According to member agency officials, mitigation measures  rarely expire; thus, the number of these measures increases over time, as  does the accompanying workload for co-lead agencies tasked with  overseeing the measures.\n\n\t\tThe Increased Complexity of CFIUS Reviews Has Increased CFIUS Workload\n\nOfficials from CFIUS member agencies stated that the complexity of  CFIUS reviews in terms of technology, transaction structure, and national  security concerns has increased in recent years. They said that additional  time and staff have been required to address this rise in complexity and to  complete these reviews. For instance, one member agency official told us  that reviews of transactions from parties whose companies use new and  emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics,  typically require input from agency subject matter experts to help the  committee understand how, if at all, the acquisition of these technologies  by foreign parties could create national security concerns.\nAccording to member agency officials, the amount of time and number of  staff needed to review a transaction can fluctuate greatly based on,  among other things, the technology involved. One agency official said that  6 of their employees, on average, are involved in reviewing a less  complex transaction, but up to 15 employees may be necessary to  complete the review if the technology involved is more complicated. The  number of agency staff involved can increase further if senior level  management is required to participate in the review. This official also  stated that most of the transactions reviewed in the past were from  sectors that agency officials were familiar with and involved more  predictable issues, but recently, transactions more frequently involved  complex technology, which required additional expertise. Officials from  another member agency stated that a majority of their staff involved in  reviewing transactions do not have CFIUS as a primary duty and that  their agency has reallocated resources to address the increased case  load. One Treasury official stated that one case was so complex that it  required one staff member to dedicate all of their time to its review, and  the other responsibilities of this employee had to be shifted to other  members of the staff.\nAdditionally, according to member agency officials, reviews of  transactions involving technologies the government frequently uses have  increased, requiring additional time and staff to understand how this  technology affects various agencies. For instance, member agency  officials said that reviewing transactions involving semiconductors, which  are commonly used in an array of products used by the government,  typically requires additional time and staff because CFIUS member  agencies must understand, among other things, how the approval of a  transaction could affect systems across government agencies.\nAccording to CFIUS member agency officials, the structures of the  transactions the committee reviews have also become more complex,  requiring more time and staff to assess. For example, business  arrangements\u2014such as complex corporate arrangements, joint ventures,  loan arrangements, nondisclosure agreements, and memoranda of  understanding\u2014may require the work of additional staff. Treasury officials  also stated that these arrangements can make it more difficult to  determine whether the transaction is covered by CFIUS authorities, as  there may be commercial relationships that affect the parties\u2019 decision- making. According to Treasury officials, such arrangements can also  increase the complexity of the national security review, as they may  create additional \u201cindirect threats\u201d that must also be analyzed.\nMember agency officials explained that it has become more challenging  to identify the ultimate beneficial owners\u2014the persons who ultimately own  and control a company\u2014due to the structure of the transaction. According  to Treasury officials, in certain countries, it can be difficult to distinguish  between control by a private entity and control by a state entity due to the  various relationships created by the transaction structure. In these cases,  CFIUS often requires additional information from the parties in such  transactions before the national security review can begin. Member  agency officials stated that they had been encountering these  arrangements more frequently, and additional time and staff had been  required to examine the national security implications of these  transactions.\nFinally, the nature of the national security concerns the committee  considers has expanded beyond the traditional threats, requiring more  time and staff to assess them, according to member agency officials.  National security concerns include traditional ones, such as threats to  U.S. critical infrastructure. Emerging concerns include the possibility of a  foreign entity obtaining access to personally identifiable information that, if  disclosed, could be exploited for purposes that have national security  consequences or the proximity of property to areas considered sensitive  by the U.S. government.\n\n\t\tTreasury Has Not Coordinated Assessments of Staffing Levels Needed to Complete CFIUS Core Functions\n\nAccording to agency officials, the number of staff assigned to CFIUS  activities has not kept pace with the increase in covered transactions  reviewed by CFIUS. According to one Treasury official, the more an  agency is required to act as co-lead, the more time and staff are needed  of the agency. After Treasury, which acts as co-lead on every review, the  Departments of Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), and Homeland Security  (DHS) acted as co-lead on the largest number of CFIUS reviews in 2016  (see table 2).\nAccording to information provided by member agency officials, CFIUS  saw a modest increase in staff assigned to CFIUS activities since 2011,  with Treasury, DOD, DOE, DHS, and State adding a few staff, while  staffing levels did not rise at the other member agencies. The total  number of staff assigned to CFIUS activities increased from 82 in 2011 to  91 in 2016, an increase of 11 percent. During that same period, covered  transactions reviewed by CFIUS increased from 111 transactions in 2011  to 172 transactions in 2016, an increase of almost 55 percent (see fig. 3).\nMember agency officials stated that the number of staff assigned to work  on CFIUS activities may fluctuate throughout the year based on the  committee\u2019s work. For example, as previously discussed, CFIUS member  agencies may rely on experts with other responsibilities throughout each  agency to provide assistance with the review as the need arises. For  instance, in fiscal year 2016, DOE had four staff dedicated to CFIUS, but  one DOE official said he reaches out to relevant subject matter experts,  who have other responsibilities, to provide input on transactions within  their area of expertise.\nTreasury officials stated that staff have been able to review the number of  transactions that have been voluntarily notified to CFIUS to date. One  Treasury official said that, despite the increase in the number of  transactions reviewed by CFIUS, the committee has almost always  provided a determination to the parties within the timeframes required as  to whether the covered transaction should be allowed to proceed or  blocked by the President. Further, Treasury officials stated that despite  staff constraints, CFIUS has, as needed, appropriately mitigated the  national security concerns for the transactions the committee has  approved.\nHowever, several member agency officials and external experts  expressed concerns that, due to staff constraints, CFIUS member  agencies were limited in their ability to complete other CFIUS functions,  such as monitoring mitigation measures and identifying non-notified  transactions. First, the time and staff necessary to monitor mitigation  measures varies. For instance, according to one member agency official,  some mitigation measures require daily monitoring from officials, while  other mitigation measures require only the review of an annual report  submitted by parties to the transaction. Several member agency officials  acknowledged that they have fewer staff than they would like to devote to  monitoring mitigation measures.\nSecond, these member agency officials also said that they are not able to  devote the amount of time they would like to the task of identifying non- notified transactions. CFIUS member agencies review data on mergers  and acquisitions to identify non-notified transactions of concern, those  that have not been notified to CFIUS for review. In recent years,  according to agency officials, CFIUS has seen an increase in the number  of non-notified transactions CFIUS could potentially review. One official  indicated that in 2016, their agency examined 2,683 potential non-notified  transactions, an increase of roughly 38 percent from 2014. Member  agency officials stated that because non-notified transactions are  frequently reviewed after the acquisition has been completed, the process  of mitigating potential national security concerns of non-notified  transactions can be difficult. Several member agency officials suggested  that they would like to devote more time to examining non-notified transactions, but staff constraints limit the amount of time agencies can  spend conducting this task.\nSeveral member agency officials said that they do not know if current  staffing levels would be able to address a further increase in CFIUS  workload. Treasury officials noted that the volume of transactions  reviewed by CFIUS will likely continue to increase. Moreover,  congressional bills have been introduced that, if enacted, would alter the  CFIUS process. As discussed later in this report, agency officials stated  that some of these potential changes would likely further increase CFIUS  workload. According to several CFIUS member agency officials, if the  CFIUS workload were to increase, additional staff would likely be  necessary to complete committee functions, such as identifying non- notified transactions and monitoring mitigation measures. Officials from  two member agencies also expressed concerns about their ability to  review transactions that have been notified to the committee if the volume  of CFIUS notices increased.\nAccording to Treasury officials, CFIUS does not have a centralized  budget, and Treasury does not have authority to determine CFIUS  staffing levels at committee member agencies. Treasury officials stated  that they have taken steps, in coordination with the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB), to collect data from the member agencies on current  staffing levels expended on CFIUS core functions but have not  established timeframes for this data collection. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government states that management should  establish the organizational structure necessary to achieve its objectives  and periodically evaluate this structure. Treasury officials stated that they  have conducted an assessment of Treasury\u2019s staffing needs and have  encouraged other agencies to do the same. However, Treasury, as  CFIUS lead, has not coordinated member agencies\u2019 efforts to better  understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and future  CFIUS workload associated with core committee functions, such as  identifying and reviewing non-notified transactions. Without this  information, CFIUS may be limited in its ability to fulfill its objectives and  address threats to the national security of the United States.\n\n\tCFIUS Member Agencies and External Experts Provided Views on Benefits and Drawbacks of Possible Changes to CFIUS\n\nOfficials from CFIUS member agencies (voting and nonvoting) and  selected nonmember participant agencies, as well as external experts,  expressed a range of views on the potential benefits and drawbacks to  possible changes to CFIUS. In our interviews with them, these  stakeholders discussed a variety of possible changes to CFIUS that we  organized into three categories: (1) altering the structure of CFIUS, (2)  redefining which merger and acquisition transactions should be  considered for CFIUS review, and (3) expanding the list of factors CFIUS  considers as it evaluates the impacts of a foreign transaction on national  security. For the most part, CFIUS member agencies and nonmember  participant agencies stated that the existing structure is working  effectively and described drawbacks to potential changes, such as  changing membership or voting rights. Perspectives among agency  officials and external experts varied on the potential effects of redefining  which transactions should be considered for review, such as requiring  CFIUS to review all covered transactions. Agency officials and external  experts described a range of potential effects of expanding the list of  factors CFIUS considers. They generally stated that including a net  economic benefit test in the review, for example, would not be beneficial.  Many officials and external experts agreed that one potential drawback of  many of the possible changes is a likely increase to the CFIUS workload,  generating concerns about the committee\u2019s capacity to complete its core  functions.\n\n\t\tAgencies Participating in CFIUS Were Generally Satisfied with the Structure of the Committee\n\nIn general, officials from member and nonmember agencies participating  in CFIUS were satisfied with the structure of the committee. Possible  changes, which would affect the way CFIUS is organized and does its  work, include changes to the chairmanship of CFIUS, changes to the  voting membership of CFIUS (adding new voting members and giving  voting rights to current nonvoting members), and changes to the  timeframes under which CFIUS works. However, for the most part, CFIUS  member agencies and nonmember participant agencies reported that the  existing structure works effectively. See tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 for details on  the perspectives expressed on these changes.\n\n\t\tPerspectives Varied on the Effects of Changes to the Types of Transactions to Be Considered for CFIUS Review\n\nMember agency officials and external experts offered a range of views  about the effects of changes to the types of transactions reviewed by  CFIUS. Possible changes, which would affect which merger and  acquisition transactions would be considered for CFIUS review, include  changes to the definition of a covered transaction and changing the  voluntary notification process to make review of all or some covered  transactions mandatory. Stakeholders we spoke with identified benefits  and drawbacks to each of these changes. Many stakeholders agreed that  one potential drawback of these possible changes is a likely increase to  the CFIUS workload. See tables 7, 8, and 9 for details on the  perspectives expressed.\n\n\t\tMost Stakeholders Were Satisfied with the Factors CFIUS Currently Considers in Reviewing Foreign Transactions\n\nMember agency officials and external experts were generally satisfied  with the list of factors CFIUS currently considers when it reviews foreign  transactions and offered a variety of opinions on the effects of changes to  them. Possible changes include expanding the statutory national security  factors to be considered and introducing an economic impact  assessment. Stakeholders we spoke with identified benefits and  drawbacks to each of these changes. See tables 10 and 11 for details on  the perspectives expressed.\n\n\tConclusions\n\nThe United States maintains an open investment climate that recognizes  the benefits of foreign investment to its economy. CFIUS reviews certain  foreign acquisitions, mergers, or takeovers of U.S. businesses to  determine the effect of the transaction on the national security of the  United States. The increased number of covered transactions notified to  CFIUS and the complexity of these cases compared with the modest  increase in the number of people assigned to reviewing them have,  according to member agency officials, taxed the staff of CFIUS member  agencies. Member agency officials and external experts have expressed  particular concern that CFIUS member agencies were limited in their  ability to complete core functions, such as identifying non-notified  transactions and monitoring mitigation measures. At the same time,  congressional bills have been introduced proposing changes to FINSA  that could increase the committee\u2019s workload. Officials from Treasury and  other member agencies are aware of pressures on their CFIUS staff  given the current workload and have expressed concerns about possible  workload increases. Treasury and OMB have begun to collect information  from agencies on their current CFIUS staffing levels. This is a crucial first  step that could facilitate a better understanding for both the committee  and Congress of the current staffing levels across the committee\u2019s  organizational structure. However, Treasury, as CFIUS lead, has not  coordinated member agency efforts to assess the current and future  staffing levels needed to complete the committee\u2019s core functions.  Without attaining an understanding of the staffing levels needed to  address the current and future CFIUS workload, particularly if legislative  changes to CFIUS\u2019s authorities further expand its workload, CFIUS may  be limited in its ability to fulfill its objectives and address threats to the  national security of the United States.\n\n\tRecommendation for Executive Action\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, as the chair of CFIUS, and working with  member agencies, should coordinate member agencies\u2019 efforts to better  understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and  projected CFIUS workload associated with core committee functions.  (Recommendation 1)\n\n\tAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\n\nWe provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the  Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and  Human Services, Homeland Security, Justice, Labor, State, and the  Treasury as well as the Offices of the U.S. Trade Representative, Science  and Technology Policy, and the Director of National Intelligence, and the  Federal Communications Commission. We also provided a draft to the  Office of Management and Budget.\nTreasury provided written comments, which are reproduced in appendix  V. In its comments, Treasury stated that it is working with OMB to  determine current resource levels across the CFIUS member agencies  and has encouraged agencies to assess their staffing needs. Treasury  also stated that it generally concurred with the draft report\u2019s  recommendation to \u201cconduct an assessment to better understand staffing  levels needed to address the current and projected CFIUS workload.\u201d  However, Treasury noted that CFIUS does not have a centralized budget,  and Treasury does not have the authority over CFIUS staffing levels at  member agencies. We acknowledge Treasury\u2019s points and, therefore, we  modified the report and clarified the recommendation to focus on  Treasury\u2019s coordination role, since, as we note in the report, Treasury is  responsible for coordinating the operations of the committee and  communicating on the committee\u2019s behalf with the parties, members of  Congress, and the general public. Treasury stated in an email that the  clarifications to the recommendation address the point raised in its  comment letter.\nUSDA also provided written comments, reproduced in appendix VI. In its  comments, USDA stated that it generally agreed with the findings in  GAO\u2019s draft report. The letter further noted that USDA is satisfied with  Treasury\u2019s willingness to include USDA in cases related to food and  agriculture and is comfortable continuing to work as a non-voting member  of CFIUS.\nThe Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, State, Treasury, and  the Offices of the U.S. Trade Representative and Science and  Technology Policy provided written technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.\nThe Departments of Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services,  Justice, Labor, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the  Federal Communications Commission indicated via email that they did  not have comments.\nAs agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Departments of  Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services,  Homeland Security, Justice, Labor, State, and the Treasury as well as the  Offices of the U.S. Trade Representative, Science and Technology  Policy, and the Director of National Intelligence, and the Federal  Communications Commission. In addition, the report will be available at  no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nIf you or your staff have questions about this report, please contact  Kimberly Gianopoulos at (202) 512-8612 or gianopoulosk@gao.gov or  Marie A. Mak at (202) 512-2527 or makm@gao.gov. Contact points for  our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found   on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to  this report are listed in appendix VII.\n\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\n\nThis report (1) examines changes in the Committee on Foreign  Investment in the United States\u2019 (CFIUS) workload and staffing from 2011  through 2016, and (2) provides information on stakeholder views on  potential changes to CFIUS.\nTo address these objectives, we reviewed relevant laws, executive  orders, and regulations. We interviewed officials from each CFIUS voting  member agency, including the Departments of Commerce, Defense,  Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, State, and the Treasury as well as  the Offices of the U.S. Trade Representative and Science and  Technology Policy. We also interviewed officials from the two nonvoting  ex officio members, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and  the Department of Labor. In addition, we interviewed officials from  nonmember agencies that have CFIUS case-related expertise, including  the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, and the  Federal Communications Commission.\nTo examine the changes in CFIUS workload and staffing levels over the  past 5 years, we analyzed information on workload and staffing levels at  the voting member agencies from 2011 through 2016, the most recent  information available at the time of our review. We also reviewed the  2014 and 2015 CFIUS annual reports. In addition, we interviewed officials  from the nine CFIUS voting member agencies about their workload and  staffing levels; any changes in the volume, types, and complexity of  transactions reviewed by CFIUS; and their ability to complete the core  functions of the committee. We requested information from the 9 CFIUS  voting member agencies on the number of staff assigned to CFIUS more  than 50 percent of their time.\nTo collect information on stakeholder views on potential changes to  CFIUS, we conducted individual semi-structured interviews with selected  stakeholders, which consisted of officials from the nine CFIUS voting  member agencies, the two ex officio nonvoting member agencies, and  three selected nonmember agencies that have CFIUS case-related  expertise, as well as with external experts. To identify external experts,  we asked stakeholders to recommend other stakeholders we should  speak with (i.e., snowball sampling). From our list of potential  stakeholders, we selected 16 external experts, including former  government officials, lawyers who represent parties with transactions  notified to CFIUS, and representatives from industry associations and  think tanks. In our interviews, we collected views and information on the  challenges that CFIUS faces, options for addressing the challenges, and  the possible benefits and drawbacks of these options. The information  obtained from these stakeholders cannot be generalized across all  stakeholders; however, these stakeholders provided insights into the  possible effects of implementing certain changes to CFIUS.\nWe conducted this performance audit from December 2016 to February  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\n\nAppendix II: Characteristics of Transactions Reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)\n\nAppendix II: Characteristics of Transactions  Reviewed by the Committee on Foreign  Investment in the United States (CFIUS)\nCFIUS reviews covered transactions from a large variety of industries, but  the largest number of transactions reviewed come from the manufacturing  sector. In 2016, the manufacturing sector represented approximately 42  percent of the 172 covered transactions reviewed by CFIUS and, in  recent years, the number of transactions reviewed from that sector has  increased from 49 transactions in 2011 to approximately 72 transactions  in 2016. Computer and electronic transactions, such as those by  companies that produce semiconductor technology, accounted for  approximately 32 of the 72 covered transactions from the manufacturing  sector that CFIUS reviewed in 2016. For instance, in 2016, CFIUS  reviewed the potential acquisition of Aixtron, a Germany-based  semiconductor firm with assets in the United States, by the Chinese firm  Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund. That year, the President chose to  prohibit the acquisition of the U.S. business of Aixtron upon determining  that the foreign purchasers might take action that threatens to impair the  national security of the United States in exercising control of the U.S.  business of Aixtron. Treasury, as the chair of CFIUS, stated in a press  release that the national security risks posed by the transaction related to,  among other things, a Chinese firm obtaining the company\u2019s body of  knowledge and experience.\nTransactions from the manufacturing sector involve a variety of other  industries, including textiles, chemicals, and food manufacturing. For  example, in 2013, according to a report from the U.S.-China Economic  and Security Review Commission, CFIUS reviewed the acquisition of  Smithfield Foods Inc., for $7.1 billion, by China\u2019s Shuanghui International  Holdings Ltd. A letter submitted by members of the Senate Agriculture  Committee raised concerns that the transaction posed a threat to the  nation\u2019s food security; however, according to Security and Exchange  Commission filings, CFIUS ultimately completed its investigation and  cleared the transaction to proceed.\nAcquisitions by Chinese-owned companies accounted for the largest  number of covered transactions reviewed by CFIUS from 2014 through  2016. According to CFIUS, the number of covered transactions the  committee reviewed from China has increased substantially in recent  years, from 10 transactions in 2011 to 67 in 2016. In previous years,  companies from the United Kingdom were party to the largest share of  covered transactions submitted for CFIUS review; however, from 2013  through 2015, parties from the United Kingdom and Canada submitted  the second and third largest number of notices. Forty-four percent of all  covered transactions reviewed by the committee during this time period  involved companies from China, the United Kingdom, or Canada.\n\nAppendix III: Factors to Determine Whether Submitted Transactions Pose a National Security Risk\n\nAppendix III: Factors to Determine Whether  Submitted Transactions Pose a National  Security Risk The potential effects of the transaction on the domestic production needed for  projected national defense requirements.  The potential effects of the transaction on the capability and capacity of domestic  industries to meet national defense requirements, including the availability of human  resources, products, technology, materials, and other supplies.  The potential effects of a foreign person\u2019s control of domestic industries and  commercial activity on the capability and capacity of the United States to meet the  requirements of national security.  The potential effects of the transaction on U.S. international technological leadership  in areas affecting U.S. national security.  The potential national security-related effects on U.S. critical technologies.  The potential effects on the long-term projection of U.S. requirements for sources of  energy and other critical resources and material.  The potential national security-related effects of the transaction on U.S. critical  infrastructure, including critical physical infrastructure such as major energy assets.  The potential effects of the transaction on the sales of military goods, equipment, or  technology to countries that present concerns related to terrorism; missile  proliferation; chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons proliferation; or regional  military threats.  The potential that the transaction presents for transshipment or diversion of  technologies with military applications, including the relevant country\u2019s export control  system.\nWhether the transaction could result in the control of a U.S. business by a foreign  government or by an entity controlled by or acting on behalf of a foreign  government.  The relevant foreign country\u2019s record of adherence to nonproliferation control  regimes and record of cooperating with U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\nOther factors that the President or the committee may determine to be appropriate,  generally or in connection with a specific review or investigation.\n\nAppendix IV: Reported Number of Agency Staff Assigned to Committee Activities\n\nDepartment of the Treasury (Chair)\n\nAppendix V: Comments from the Department of the Treasury\n\nAppendix VI: Comments from the Department of Agriculture\n\nAppendix VII: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments\n\n\tGAO Contacts\n\nKimberly M.

Mak, (202) 512-4841 or makm@gao.gov.\n\n\tStaff Acknowledgments\n\nIn addition to the contacts named above, Christine Broderick (Assistant  Director), Christina Werth (Analyst-in-Charge), Anthony Costulas, Scott  Purdy, Kendal Robinson, Lynn Cothern, Grace Lui, Justin Fisher, and Neil  Doherty contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "Why GAO Did This Study\n\nThe United States economy has historically been the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world\u2014receiving $373 billion in 2016, according to U.S. government statistics. Ensuring that these foreign investments do not harm national security can be a challenge. CFIUS is an interagency group that reviews transactions under its authority\u2014certain foreign acquisitions or mergers of U.S. businesses\u2014to determine their effects on U.S. national security, while maintaining an open investment climate. If CFIUS identifies concerns, it may work with parties to the transaction to mitigate them. In rare cases, CFIUS may recommend that the President block or suspend a transaction.\nGAO was asked to review the CFIUS process and possible changes to that process. This report (1) examines changes in CFIUS's workload and staffing from 2011 through 2016, and (2) provides information on stakeholder views on potential changes to CFIUS. GAO analyzed CFIUS information on staffing levels and transactions reviewed, and interviewed officials from member agencies, selected nonmember agencies that have CFIUS-related expertise, and knowledgeable external experts, such as think tanks.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nstates that management should establish the organizational structure necessary to achieve its objectives and periodically evaluate this structure. Treasury\u2014the agency that leads CFIUS\u2014 has not coordinated member agencies' efforts to better understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and future workload associated with core functions of the committee. Without this information, CFIUS may be limited in its ability to fulfill its objectives and address national security concerns.\nOfficials from CFIUS member agencies and selected nonmember agencies, as well as external experts, expressed a range of views on the potential benefits and drawbacks to possible changes to CFIUS. GAO organized the possible changes into three categories: (1) altering the structure of CFIUS, (2) redefining which transactions should be considered for CFIUS review, and (3) expanding the factors CFIUS considers when evaluating the impacts of a foreign transaction on national security. Agency officials were generally satisfied with CFIUS' structure, such as the committee's chair and membership. Views among officials and experts varied on redefining which transactions should be considered for review, such as requiring CFIUS to review all transactions covered by its authority regardless of notification. Officials and experts generally did not support expanding the list of national security factors CFIUS considers, such as by adding a net economic benefit test. Agency officials and experts agreed that one trade-off related to some possible changes is a likely increase to the CFIUS workload, which they noted is already straining agencies' staff resources.\n\nWhat GAO Recommends\n\nTreasury, as CFIUS lead, should coordinate member agencies' efforts to better understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and projected CFIUS workload associated with core committee functions. Treasury concurred.",

    "input": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBackground\n\n\t\tThe National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking and Reducing Demand\n\nThe 2014 National Strategy defines wildlife trafficking as including all  aspects of the trade, from poaching and transit through consumer use.  The National Strategy outlines the guiding principles and strategic  priorities for U.S. efforts to stem illegal trade in wildlife, and one of the top  three priorities identified is to \u201cReduce Demand for Illegally Traded  Wildlife.\u201d Specifically, the National Strategy states that, as a strategic  priority, reducing demand for illegally traded wildlife calls for raising public  awareness of the harms done by wildlife trafficking through outreach in  the United States and public diplomacy abroad. The National Strategy  also states that the Task Force will seek to enlist individual consumers in  this fight through education and outreach to reduce demand for these  products and change consumption patterns that drive wildlife trafficking.\nWhile the Implementation Plan outlines a unique set of activities to reduce  demand, other activities under the plan\u2019s objectives may indirectly affect  demand. For example, one of the objectives under \u201cReduce Demand for  Illegally Traded Wildlife\u201d is to raise public awareness and recognition of  wildlife trafficking and its negative impacts and associated risks of  prosecution (emphasis added) as a means to change harmful  consumption patterns. Implementing robust legal frameworks and  effective enforcement increases the risk of prosecution, which may deter  not only wildlife traffickers but also consumers, who may risk legal  penalties. For the purposes of this report, we consider efforts to reduce  consumption of wildlife and law enforcement efforts to prevent illegal use  of wildlife as demand reduction-related activities.\nThe Implementation Plan designates various U.S. agencies to lead or  participate in achieving the strategic priority of reducing demand for  illegally traded wildlife, which are outlined in table 1.\nIn fiscal years 2014 through 2017, Congress directed that not less than  certain specified amounts, totaling $271 million over the 4 fiscal years, be  made available to combat wildlife trafficking (see fig. 1).\n\n\t\tGlobal Efforts to Reduce Wildlife Trafficking\n\nSince September 2016, U.S. agencies and global stakeholders have  taken a range of actions to address CWT issues (see fig. 2). For example,  in October 2016, Congress passed the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt  (END) Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016. Among other things, the act calls  for the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretaries of the  Interior and Commerce, to submit an annual report that lists each country  determined by the Secretary of State to be a focus country and a country  of concern. The act also directs the Task Force to submit an annual  strategic assessment of its work and provide a briefing to Congress.  Additionally, the 17th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties for the  Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna  and Flora (CITES) took place September 24, 2016, to October 5, 2016.  In December 2016, China announced that it would close its domestic  ivory market by the end of 2017, and in March 2017, China announced  closure of 67 ivory carving entities and retail outlets across the country.\n\n\t\tEstimates of the Illegal Wildlife Trade\n\nAs reported by the United Nations, the International Criminal Police  Organization (INTERPOL), and other sources, wildlife trafficking networks  span the globe. Although sources have attempted to measure trade flows,  there is no precise estimate of illegally traded wildlife, and available  estimates are subject to uncertainty. In 2014, the United Nations  Environment Programme (UNEP) reported that various sources estimate  the global scale of illegal wildlife trade is between $7 billion and $23  billion annually. In 2016, UNEP and INTERPOL estimated that the scale  of wildlife crime may have increased, based on a rise in environmental  crime. They estimate that environmental crime increased by 26 percent  since 2014 and continues to increase by 5 to 7 percent annually. Illegal,  unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing often are not included in these  estimates since discussion of wildlife trafficking, as it relates to marine  species, focuses on those species protected under CITES and under  statutes such as the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal  Protection Act, according to NOAA. While IUU fishing targets  commercially harvested marine species, as the Implementation Plan  outlines, the trafficking of fisheries products is a form of wildlife trafficking.  In 2016, UNEP and INTERPOL estimated that the global scale of IUU  fishing ranges from $11 billion to $24 billion annually.\n\n\tDemand for Illegal Wildlife and Wildlife Products Is Difficult to Measure, but Data and Reports Indicate Range of Species and Products Is Diverse\n\nThe United States, China, and countries in Southeast Asia consume  many types of legal and illegal wildlife for diverse purposes. It is difficult  to measure demand for illegal wildlife and wildlife products due to the illicit  nature of the trade, but various data sources and reports provide  examples of the range of wildlife demand by illustrating types of wildlife  that are seized by governments and purchased by consumers.\n\n\t\tIllegal Wildlife Demand and Trade Are Diverse in the United States\n\nU.S. trade in wildlife and wildlife products includes a variety of wildlife  such as live reptiles, birds, mammals, and elephant ivory, according to  law enforcement information, reports, and government and NGO officials.  FWS and NOAA data on wildlife products seized at U.S. ports provide  examples of the diversity of illegally traded wildlife in the United States.  FWS and NOAA may seize wildlife products for a variety of reasons that include import, export, or sale of endangered or threatened species  protected under U.S. laws and regulations. For example, FWS may  seize a shipment due to invalid documentation needed to clear the  shipment. From 2007 to 2016, the top 10 wildlife shipments\u2014by species  or species group\u2014seized nationally by FWS were coral, crocodile, conch,  deer, python, sea turtle, mollusks, ginseng, clam, and seahorse. These  seized wildlife were in a variety of forms when confiscated, as shown in  table 2. For example, more than half of seized seahorse shipments were  dead whole animals, and a smaller percentage were medicinal parts or  products. During the past 10 years, more than one-third of the wildlife  shipments seized by FWS were confiscated while being imported from or  exported to Mexico (13.6 percent), China (13 percent), Canada (8.6  percent). Additional examples of wildlife seized by FWS are shown in  figure 3 and in appendix II.\nSeizure data from NOAA Fisheries\u2019 Office of Law Enforcement show that  it has also seized a variety of marine wildlife products. From 2007 to  2016, confiscated shipments have included whale teeth and meat, seal oil  pills, shark fins, and seal fur products like mittens and boots, according to  NOAA\u2019s seizure data. Seizure data from FWS and NOAA provide a  helpful illustration of wildlife that has been confiscated at U.S. ports but  may not be fully reflective of the illegal wildlife trade and consumption.\nSeizure data show the types of wildlife confiscated at ports of entry in a  country, but there are limits to what these data can tell us about the  demand for products like illegally traded wildlife. Various factors influence  the number of seizures at any given time or in any location such as the  level of illicit trade and the level and efficacy of enforcement efforts. For  example, as part of their enforcement, both NOAA and FWS conduct  inspections of shipments at U.S. ports. In some cases, they conduct  targeted inspections that may be based on information they have about a  particular species or market, which may influence detection and seizures  of illegal products. NOAA and FWS officials indicated that they can  increase their enforcement efforts by targeting investigations on specific  species or products. This additional effort may result in the seizure of  more shipments than would be made using routine inspection processes.\nIn 2016, the NGO WildAid published a baseline survey conducted by  KRC Research to inform a public awareness campaign effort with FWS.  The survey reported that roughly 1 in 10 respondents in the United States  indicated that they had purchased or knew someone who had purchased  live animals such as iguanas, parrots, parakeets, or tortoises. A smaller  proportion of those that responded (roughly 1 in 20) reported that they  had purchased or knew someone who had purchased ivory. Reporting by  the International Fund for Animal Welfare in 2013 also identifies the  United States as a key end market for reptiles such as crocodiles,  pythons, and caimans and for wildlife products such as ivory.\nBased on reporting and discussions with U.S. government officials, there  may be varying reasons for the demand for wildlife and wildlife products.  Potential drivers of demand in the United States\u2014in particular demand for  illegal wildlife from Latin America\u2014 may include a desire for rare and  exotic plants and animals, according to reporting by Defenders of  Wildlife. FWS officials in Miami told us that some of the wildlife products  they confiscate\u2014such as products from cruise passengers\u2014 were  purchased by travelers who were unaware of the restrictions on the  wildlife product. FWS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  officials told us that consumers use wildlife for many different purposes,  including as pets, trophies, jewelry, food, religious items, and for  medicinal purposes. For example, FWS officials in Miami told us that  coral is often smuggled as part of the pet trade for use in aquariums. At  the Port of Miami, an FWS official told us that FWS has also seized  queen conch meat, which is exported from the Caribbean as a delicacy, according to FWS. During investigations, FWS has found wildlife  intended to be used as art or trophies. During the course of their  investigations, FWS officials in Miami have found a rhino bust being sold  for $80,000 and a giraffe bust being sold for $100,000. FWS has also  seized scarlet macaw feathers being used in jewelry, elephant ivory  carved as decorative pieces, and taxidermy big cats seized as hunting  trophies.\n\n\t\tIllegal Wildlife Demand and Trade Are Diverse in China and Countries in Southeast Asia\n\nDemand for illegally traded wildlife in China and countries in Southeast  Asia includes many wildlife species and end uses, according to reports  and government and NGO officials in the region. For example, iconic  wildlife such as elephants and rhinos are often cited in reports and by  officials in the field as examples of wildlife consumption in China and  Southeast Asia, but other wildlife, such as pangolins, bears, sharks, and  sea turtles are also named among the wildlife being consumed.\nChina is a consumption country for illegal wildlife, while Hong Kong,  Thailand, and Vietnam are consumption and transit locations, according  to officials we spoke with from the U.S. government, foreign governments,  international organizations, and NGOs in these locations. Thailand often  serves as a transshipment point for illegal wildlife due to its land borders  with China, Laos, and Cambodia, according to government of Thailand  officials. Government officials in Vietnam stated a similar claim, explaining  that the country is often a transshipment point due to its land borders with  China and Laos. Table 3 displays examples of wildlife consumed and  trafficked in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Vietnam, according to U.S.  government, foreign government, and NGO officials in-location and at  DOI Headquarters.\nThe International Fund for Animal Welfare has reported that China is the  world\u2019s largest consumer of illegal wildlife products due to its demand for  ivory, rhino horn, pangolin scales, bear bile, tiger bone, and shark fin  soup. According to analysis by the United Nations Office on Drugs and  Crime (UNODC) of seizure data from the World Wildlife Seizure  database, China was the destination for about 40 percent of the ivory  shipments that had reported destinations from 2006 to 2015.\nReports also identify Thailand as a part of the illegal ivory trade.  INTERPOL\u2019s 2015 investigation, Operation Worthy II, resulted in seizures  of several tons of elephant ivory in Thailand and Singapore. TRAFFIC,  the wildlife trade monitoring network, visited retail outlets in Bangkok,  Thailand, during certain periods in 2013 and 2014 and, through covert  surveys of vendors, found bangles, rings, toothpicks, hairpins, chopsticks,  sculptures, and other products made of ivory for sale. TRAFFIC reports  that for seven consecutive months, from November 2013 to May 2014,  their surveys found more than 10,000 ivory items openly on display for  sale in Bangkok.\nAn NGO official we spoke with in China told us that part of the NGO\u2019s  efforts includes targeting Chinese tourists traveling to Africa and  Southeast Asia to prevent purchasing of ivory as well as rhino horn.  UNODC has reported that more than two-thirds of rhino horns seized  from 2006 to 2015 were destined for China or Vietnam.\nGovernment officials in Hong Kong told us that they have also seized a  variety of wildlife products such as pangolin scales and turtles. Examples  of wildlife products seized by the government of Hong Kong are shown in  figure 4 and in appendix II. Hong Kong\u2019s government has also seized  elephant ivory, though as of March 2017, certain registered ivory can be  legally traded in Hong Kong under a license.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reports  that high economic growth may fuel consumer demand for status goods  such as art from elephant ivory and traditional medicine using rhino horn.  According to NGO officials we met with in Vietnam and China, consumers  purchase illegal wildlife products as a status symbol or to demonstrate  wealth. Wildlife is considered to be expensive and exotic in these  countries, and there is conspicuous consumption in some areas,  according to State officials in Vietnam and an FWS attach\u00e9. UNODC  reports that a survey of 18 restaurants\u2014 identified as high end by  UNODC\u2014 in Vietnam found that all of these restaurants sold pangolin  meat. UNEP and INTERPOL describe a similar phenomenon of a culture  of conspicuous consumption for wildlife products that indicate wealth.  These organizations report that buyers place higher value on illegal  wildlife products when they are considered rare and uncommon and thus  drive up prices for illegal wildlife. Higher prices and the perception of  luxury associated with products such as tiger pelts and shark fin soup  may attract consumers who want to display their wealth, according to  Global Financial Integrity.\nAnother end use of illegally traded wildlife is in traditional medicine in  China and Vietnam, according to State and NGO officials in these  countries. They stated that there are beliefs that certain wildlife provide  health benefits; for example, pangolin scales are believed to help  lactating mothers produce milk. State and NGO officials noted that  traditional Chinese medicine has a long history of using various wildlife  products. For example, American ginseng root is often consumed as a  medicinal ingredient in China, according to FWS. While export of  American ginseng is permitted, there are restrictions based on factors  such as the age of the root. FWS has seized American ginseng root being  exported from the United States to China, and the Hong Kong  government has seized American ginseng being smuggled into Hong  Kong. For additional examples of how wildlife is consumed, see the side  bar for results from surveys conducted by USAID\u2019s Asia\u2019s Regional  Response to Endangered Species Trafficking (ARREST) program.\n\n\tAgencies Are Implementing Demand Reduction Efforts, but Opportunities Exist to Improve Collaboration in Southeast Asia FWS Raises Awareness and Enforces Laws in the United States and Builds Capacity Abroad\n\n\t\tState Contributes to CWT- Related Diplomacy, Training, and Outreach\n\nState has led diplomacy efforts and implemented training and outreach  programs in Southeast Asia and China.\nDiplomacy: State\u2019s diplomatic CWT efforts have included  coordinating discussions between the U.S. and Chinese presidents in  2015 that, according to State, contributed to China and the United  States jointly committing to further restrict ivory exports and imports.  In June 2016, State and China\u2019s State Forestry Administration also  led the breakout session on wildlife trafficking during the eighth round  of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Beijing. In  December 2016, China announced that it would implement a  domestic ivory ban, and in March 2017, China announced the closure  of approximately one-third of the country\u2019s licensed ivory stores and  carvers.\nTraining programs: State\u2019s INL works to build law enforcement  capacity abroad by supporting various trainings and workshops. For  example, in 2015, Thailand INL funded training in wildlife trafficking  and environmental crimes for 179 participants. In 2016, ILEA Bangkok  sponsored two FWS-led CWT training courses and one environmental  crimes course led by officials of the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency. During our field visit to Bangkok, we observed an ILEA  course on combating wildlife trafficking for law enforcement officers,  which is shown in figure 7. Through the United Nations Office on  Drugs and Crime, INL funds Border Liaison Offices in Burma,  Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, intended to enhance  interdiction and investigation capacity at land borders to prevent illicit  trafficking. At these offices, INL has supported training for officials on  wildlife trafficking detection and investigations.\nOutreach efforts: State has supported and implemented activities to  raise awareness about wildlife trafficking in Southeast Asia and China.\nFor example, State collaborated with USAID and the government of  Vietnam to implement Operation Game Change, a 2015 awareness- raising effort designed to inform the Vietnamese public about wildlife  trafficking issues such as the trade in rhino horn. In 2016, for World  Wildlife Day, State\u2019s Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans  and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs published an  opinion editorial for the South China Post in Hong Kong to raise  awareness about the illegal trade in elephant ivory.\n\n\t\tFour Major Initiatives Frame USAID CWT Efforts in Asia\n\nUSAID conducts a range of CWT activities that are part of biodiversity,  conservation, or other initiatives, but it has four major initiatives explicitly  dedicated to CWT in Asia.\nAsia\u2019s Regional Response to Endangered Species Trafficking:  ARREST was a multiyear program completed in 2016. The program  was designed to curb wildlife trafficking by reducing consumer  demand, strengthening law enforcement capacity, and boosting  regional learning networks. As part of ARREST\u2019s demand reduction  objective, the program implemented various awareness-raising efforts  such as the iThink campaign, which developed and displayed public  service announcements in airports and subways in China, Thailand,  and Vietnam and on television stations in China and Vietnam.  Through the initiative dubbed \u201cWildlife Friendly Skies,\u201d the ARREST  program raised awareness among airline and airport staff in transport  hubs identified as hotspots for wildlife trafficking, which included  Bangkok, Thailand; Guangzhou, China; Hanoi, Vietnam; Nairobi,  Kenya; and Nanning, China. The ARREST program also held various  courses aimed at strengthening capacity across Asia. For example,  the program held 14 courses for 195 trainees who were from  Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand,  and Vietnam to train participants on completing wildlife crime  investigations.\nSaving Species: This USAID project began in 2016 and is a 5-year,  $9.9 million effort to combat wildlife trafficking in Vietnam. The project  specifically aims to reduce consumer demand for and consumption of  illegal wildlife and wildlife products, strengthen wildlife law  enforcement and prosecution, and improve and harmonize the legal  framework for prosecuting wildlife crimes in Vietnam. Some of the  project\u2019s planned activities for the first year include market surveys  focused on demand for wildlife such as elephant ivory, rhinos,  pangolins, and tigers. The project plans to use the survey results to  inform its awareness campaign messaging. The project also plans to  conduct capacity assessments of enforcement agencies in Vietnam to  inform development of targeted training curricula, modules, and  materials.\nWildlife Asia: This USAID activity, in collaboration with the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations, aims to reduce the demand  for wildlife products and to improve regional action to end wildlife  crime in Southeast Asia and China. As of August 2016, USAID has  issued one contract, with an estimated value of $22.9 million, to  implement this activity.\nProtect Wildlife: This USAID project began in 2016 and is a 5-year,  $24.5 million effort to reduce threats to biodiversity in the Philippines  such as poaching and the illegal trade of wildlife and wildlife products  as well as to sustain healthy ecosystems. USAID is working with  public and private partners in the Philippines to strengthen  conservation policies and improve habitat management and on-site  and off-site enforcement systems.\nUSAID also conducts biodiversity and conservation initiatives that have  CWT-related objectives but are not dedicated solely to CWT. For  example, USAID implemented the Ecosystems Improved for Sustainable  Fisheries project in the Philippines, designed to conserve marine  biodiversity, enhance ecosystem productivity, and improve law  enforcement at fisheries to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated  fishing.\n\n\t\tOther Agencies Also Contribute to CWT\n\nDOJ, NOAA, and Homeland Security also support efforts to combat  wildlife trafficking in the United States and Asia. DOJ prosecutes criminals  and publicizes through press releases the results of criminal convictions  to encourage public awareness of this issue. DOJ also has participated in  capacity-building workshops in Burma, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam and  CWT events such as the 2016 Hanoi Conference on Illegal Wildlife Trade  and the annual U.S.\u2013China Joint Liaison Group on law enforcement, in  which DOJ, State\u2019s INL, and other agencies participate in the Anti- smuggling Working Group. According to DOJ officials, DOJ also regularly  advocates the use of the United Nations Transnational Organized Crime  Convention as a legal basis for international cooperation to combat  wildlife trafficking.\nDomestically, NOAA inspects and seizes shipments at U.S. ports,  investigates cases of wildlife trafficking, and raises awareness about  wildlife crimes. NOAA has a liaison at Homeland Security\u2019s CTAC and,  according to NOAA officials, the CTAC has allowed NOAA to more  proactively target shipments and improve coordination with FWS and  CBP through daily interaction and more information sharing. As part of  their efforts to raise awareness about wildlife trafficking, NOAA also works  with DOJ, FWS, and State\u2019s Bureau of Public Affairs to publicly report  information on and raise awareness about law enforcement efforts such  as seizures. Internationally, NOAA provides technical assistance,  conducts capacity-building, and serves as a resource in international  policy discussions. For example, in collaboration with USAID, an analysis  unit from NOAA assisted the Philippines in developing an intelligence  assessment of illegal trade and trafficking in marine species. In November  2015, NOAA Office of Law Enforcement officers participated in the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations Trade and Environmental  Dialogue in Malaysia, providing presentations on illegal, unreported, and  unregulated (IUU) fishing and ways to combat the trade in IUU fish and  fish products.\nDHS\u2019s CBP supports and coordinates with FWS and NOAA to interdict  illegal wildlife shipments at U.S. ports. ICE HSI investigates wildlife crime  in the United States, and in Asia it supports foreign government CWT  efforts through capacity building and information sharing. For example, in  Vietnam, ICE HSI regularly shares information on wildlife seizures with  the host government to support investigations. In 2015, in Thailand, ICE  HSI conducted a 5-day workshop on advanced wildlife trafficking  investigations for officials across the government.\n\n\t\tDisagreement on Roles and Responsibilities Hindered Some CWT Activities in Southeast Asia\n\nAlthough agencies have worked together to combat wildlife trafficking,  disagreement on roles and responsibilities has hindered some CWT  activities in Southeast Asia, according to some officials. In prior work, we  defined collaboration broadly as any joint activity that is intended to  produce more public value than could be produced when the  organizations act alone. We also identified practices that can enhance  and sustain collaborative efforts, including establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies, defining and articulating a common outcome, and agreeing on roles and responsibilities.\nWe found that agencies applied some collaboration mechanisms but also  have an opportunity to improve on agreeing on roles and responsibilities.  For example, the White House established a joint strategy, the National  Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking, in 2014. The strategy lays out  guiding principles and strategic priorities for U.S. efforts to stem illegal  trade in wildlife. In Southeast Asia, the U.S. embassy in Malaysia\u2019s  Integrated Country Strategy articulates mission goals and objectives for a  coordinated effort among all U.S. agencies and includes prevention of  illegal wildlife trafficking as a key activity, according to officials. In  addition, U.S. missions in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, Nepal,  Thailand, and Vietnam are developing CWT-specific country strategies,  according to officials.\nAgencies also defined and articulated a common outcome, outlined in the  National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking Implementation Plan  (Implementation Plan). The Implementation Plan states that success  relies on agencies working in concert to carry out the objectives, which  include strengthening enforcement, reducing demand for illegally traded  wildlife, and building international cooperation. Under three strategic  priorities, the Implementation Plan identifies 24 objectives and ways to  measure progress for each. In Southeast Asia, State and USAID officials  told us that they work toward those shared outcomes. In particular, they  stated that to achieve the shared outcome of reducing demand for wildlife  products, they cooperated on raising public awareness. For example,  State collaborated with USAID in Vietnam to implement Operation Game  Change, a 2015 awareness-raising effort designed to inform the  Vietnamese public about wildlife trafficking issues. In addition, to achieve  the common outcome of strengthening law enforcement capacity, USAID  is partnering with State, FWS, and DHS and other nongovernmental  actors to implement the Reducing Opportunities for Unlawful Transport of  Endangered Species program, which aims to increase enforcement  capacity at ports of entry in Vietnam and other countries.\nThe Implementation Plan designates various U.S. agencies to lead or  participate in achieving CWT strategic priorities, so it provides high-level  direction on agency roles. However, the Implementation Plan does not  define specific roles and responsibilities at the working level for mission  staff implementing programs and activities. Officials at some missions  reported that agreement on roles, responsibilities, and priorities facilitated  collaboration on CWT activities in some instances. For example, an FWS  attach\u00e9 in the region told us that there has been effective collaboration  between FWS, State, and ICE HSI due to agreement on roles and a  shared understanding of key law enforcement terms and responsibilities.  In Thailand, FWS and ICE HSI officials told us that they share information  on cases, and FWS and State officials indicated that they have jointly  conducted a variety of capacity-building activities across the region. State  officials at ILEA in Bangkok attributed their successful regional  collaboration with FWS to a mutual understanding that CWT capacity  building is a responsibility that should be prioritized. State officials in  Cambodia indicated that their Embassy CWT Interagency Working Group  has been a forum for discussion among agencies in Cambodia to  collaborate on CWT roles and activities. The working group has a  designated lead agency and provides a forum to prevent or resolve  potential differences in points of view among the agencies.\nHowever, some officials also reported instances of disagreement on roles  and responsibilities that they said led to bad outcomes. For example, at  the mission in Bangkok, Thailand, which coordinates CWT activities  across the Southeast Asia region, agencies\u2019 disagreements on roles and  responsibilities have resulted in the delivery of inappropriate training  activities and interference with U.S. efforts to cooperate with a foreign  government, according to some officials. Specifically, FWS, State, and  ICE HSI have disagreed with USAID on the roles and responsibilities that  USAID implementing partners play with regard to law enforcement  activities. USAID officials stated that they entrust their implementing  partners to conduct law enforcement training and believe they sufficiently  involve their U.S. agency counterparts. However, FWS, State, and ICE  HSI officials believe that due to their law enforcement responsibilities  specifically related to strengthening host countries\u2019 antiwildlife trafficking  enforcement efforts, they should be consulted and involved to a greater  degree on activities directly related to such efforts.\nIn Thailand, a USAID implementing partner\u2019s lack of collaboration with  U.S. law enforcement entities resulted in inappropriate training activities,  according to some officials. Officials from FWS, ICE HSI, and an NGO  told us that a CWT course conducted by a USAID implementing partner in  Thailand was inappropriate due to a focus on ambush and military tactics,  which are not suitable for the park rangers that received the training. In  addition, another training course conducted in Thailand was not tailored  for that country\u2019s landscape, according to a U.S. official, who explained  that the Thai officers receiving the training would be unable to apply its  lessons locally due to differences in terrain. FWS and ICE HSI officials  stated that they were not sufficiently consulted prior to the training and,  although they have provided feedback to USAID about these issues, they  expressed concern that USAID had not fully considered the feedback.  USAID officials indicated that training on ambush or military tactics would  not have been allowed, and they have no evidence it occurred. USAID  officials also stated that they were unaware of training that was not  properly tailored and that host countries generally praised training that  was provided by its implementing partner.\nFWS and State officials in Thailand also told us that agencies\u2019 and  implementing partners\u2019 efforts to share information on wildlife crime with  foreign governments have been fragmented due to disagreements about  roles. For example, USAID\u2019s implementing partners and FWS separately  approached foreign government entities to provide information or support  during a recent law enforcement seizure of wildlife products. According to  State and FWS officials in Thailand, while USAID\u2019s implementing partner  has a role in providing information that can support CWT activities, U.S.  agencies in-country are responsible for official engagement on law  enforcement matters and, therefore, should take the lead in  communicating with host governments, particularly in criminal  investigations.\nAccording to USAID officials, USAID and its implementing partners share  this responsibility and have a role to play. USAID officials told us that they  were aware of the difference in views and acknowledged that there may  have been instances in which an implementing partner overstepped.  USAID officials further explained that they have made an effort to address  this particular issue by changing its implementing partner as well as  changing their CWT program structure from a cooperative agreement to a  contract so that USAID has more oversight and control. The new  implementing partner also brought in a law enforcement expert to help  ensure that training and related activities will be appropriate, according to  USAID officials. In addition, the new USAID program specifies that  coordination with other agencies is required, and USAID conducted a  regional workshop in March 2017 to serve as a mechanism for  coordination.\nHowever, even after this conference, officials indicated that some  agencies still had not agreed on the appropriate balance for how  implementing partners should collaborate with U.S. law enforcement on  criminal investigations. According to State and FWS officials, differences  in agency views of their roles have hindered U.S. efforts to cooperate with  a foreign government and confuse foreign government officials who may  not realize that an implementing partner is not a U.S. government agency  and thus does not have the same authority. USAID officials indicated that  they were unaware of instances where its implementing partner interfered  with U.S. efforts to cooperate with a foreign government.\nOur work has shown that although collaborative mechanisms differ in  complexity and scope, they all benefit from certain key features, including  clarity of roles and responsibilities. For example, our work also notes that  agreement on roles and responsibilities helped agencies determine who  will lead a collaborative effort, clarify who will perform specific tasks,  organize joint and individual efforts, and facilitate decision making. In  addition, we have previously reported that key issues agencies should  consider whether participating agencies have clarified the roles and  responsibilities of participants in collaborative efforts and whether  participating agencies have agreed to a process for making and enforcing  decisions. Some U.S. missions in Southeast Asia are developing CWT- specific country strategies, which could provide a platform for the Task  Force to give additional guidance on roles and responsibilities of mission  staff engaged in CWT efforts in the region. Doing so would help clarify  which agency will do what and facilitate maximum use of resources.\n\n\tFWS, State, and USAID Have Taken Steps to Assess CWT Activities\n\n\t\tFWS, State, and USAID Monitor CWT Activities\n\nFWS uses a range of measures to track the progress of its partners and  grantees. For example, FWS has established standard indicators for  CWT, which include the following:  the number of arrests of large-scale wildlife traffickers resulting from a  project\u2019s investigations, operations support, or both; and  the number of wildlife traffickers who have been arrested who are  successfully prosecuted.\nSpecifically for public relations efforts, the guidance calls for applicants to  identify the desired behavior that the campaign is intended to encourage.  In addition, FWS required 2017 CWT project proposals to identify all  expected outputs or products of key project activities. This may include  management plans, brochures, posters, training manuals, number of  people trained, workshops held, hours of training provided, and  equipment purchased.\nOne FWS-funded program designed to counter pangolin trafficking to  China by laying the foundations for reducing consumer demand provides  an illustrative example of how it applied FWS monitoring guidance.  Among other activities, the program proposed developing and piloting  strategies to change behavior, with the goal of eliminating the market for  illegally traded wildlife in key areas. The proposal identifies outputs, such  as reports on consumer demand, and states that key components of  developing a demand reduction strategy include identification of target  audiences and the specific behaviors that the campaign aims to change.  Quarterly reports as of April 2017 have described progress toward goals,  outlining methodological details on how motivation and potential barriers  for desired behavior will be measured. The program is scheduled to  conclude in September 2017.\nThe FWS Office of Law Enforcement Strategic Plan 2016 \u2013 2020  identifies a set of CWT-related metrics for CWT, such as interdictions,  penalties, fines, and value of illegal activities. FWS reports this  information publicly. For example, Operation Crash, an ongoing  nationwide criminal investigation led by FWS that focuses on the illegal  trade in rhinoceros horn and elephant ivory, has resulted in 32 individuals  sentenced and approximately 34 years of total prison sentences, $2  million in fines, and $6 million in forfeitures as of February 2017.\nRegarding U.S.-based partnerships, FWS monitored the U.S. Illegal  Wildlife Demand Reduction Campaign by tracking the estimated number  of people who see the ads (reach) and the number of times content is  displayed (impressions). From launch through the middle of the second  quarter of fiscal year 2017, FWS reported the following:\nBillboards: Monthly, about 5 million travelers are estimated to pass by  the airport billboards at the international airports of Atlanta, Georgia;  Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and Miami, Florida. To date,  an estimated total of about 45 million travelers have passed through  these airports and may have seen the messages.\nSocial media: On September 7, 2016, FWS and its implementing  partner, WildAid, launched the campaign with joint press conferences  held at the Atlanta International Airport and at the Los Angeles  International Airport. This resulted in more than 1 million impressions  on Twitter, engagement of more than 236,000 friends on Facebook,  and 5,000 new followers on Instagram.\nIn addition, at the beginning of the campaign, WildAid completed a public  survey to assess what percentage of the U.S. general public was aware  of wildlife trafficking. At the conclusion of the 3-year campaign, WildAid  intends to facilitate another public survey to evaluate the effectiveness of  the campaign, with results expected in late 2018.\n\n\t\t\tState\n\nINL\u2019s Guide to Developing a Performance Measurement Plan states that  program teams are to monitor project activities and results in order to  identify project successes and challenges, guide resource allocations,  and facilitate improved performance. According to a State official, INL  requires every CWT program implementer to provide quarterly progress  and financial reports and final programmatic and financial reports.  Quarterly reports must provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of  work performed and include, among other things, results achieved,  challenges encountered, and action taken. At the end of a program, INL  extracts best practices and lessons learned for future planning, according  to a State official.\nWe examined monitoring documentation related to three INL CWT  programs as illustrative examples, described below.\nFrom February to March 2016, State\u2019s ILEA in Thailand provided a  Wildlife Trafficking Investigators course designed to cover a range of  topics, including case management, corruption, and wildlife  identification. The report covering the first quarter of calendar year  2016 for this program describes progress made toward objectives and  identifies challenges and corrective action. For example, the report  states that students participated in crime scene processing,  surveillance, undercover operations, interviewing, raid planning, and  case presentation exercises \u2013 all reflective of a specific performance  measurement objective. The report also identifies challenges such as  securing role players for exercises and proposes using FWS  instructors and ILEA staff as a solution.\nState provided an approximately $2 million grant, running from  September 2015 to September 2017, to the Wildlife Conservation  Society (WCS) aimed at strengthening the capacity of government  and law enforcement officials on wildlife trafficking across key  countries in Latin America and Asia. The report covering the first  quarter of calendar year 2017 for this program describes progress and  activities related to objectives. For example, one activity is intended to  strengthen legislative frameworks to combat wildlife trafficking, and  the report states that in Vietnam, WCS has been providing inputs to  articles of the penal code relevant to wildlife protection.\nState provided approximately $400,000 to UNODC and the University  of Washington for a program running from September 2015 to  September 2017 to facilitate forensic DNA analysis of ivory seizures in  Africa and Asia. The most recent quarterly report for the program  provides information on results associated with objectives. For  example, one objective is to conduct DNA analysis on 175 African  elephant reference samples, and the report indicates that over 100  samples had been analyzed from countries in Africa.\nUSAID\u2019s Evaluation Policy states that performance monitoring reveals  whether implementation is on track and that project managers will ensure  that implementing partners collect relevant monitoring data. To monitor  ARREST, USAID\u2019s implementing partner collected and self-reported data  on activities and progress against main goals. For example, the  implementing partner reported in 2016 that to strengthen law  enforcement, ARREST trained approximately 2,300 people. To reduce  consumption of endangered species, ARREST\u2019s iThink campaign at its  peak reached more than 40 million people per day, according to the  partner\u2019s report. In addition, a contractor analyzed ARREST\u2019s iThink  demand reduction campaign results. According to its report, 62 percent of  the audience in China had received the message after 6 months. In  Thailand, 63 percent of the audience had received the message, while in  Vietnam, 75 percent of the audience had received the message. The  report also provided suggestions for future work based on lessons  learned, such as segmenting the market, incorporating social norms, and  increasing the emphasis on social media.\nUSAID designed monitoring elements into and developed plans for its  recently initiated programs in Southeast Asia. For example, USAID\u2019s  request for proposal (RFP) for Saving Species Vietnam, issued in  January 2016 prior to the contract award, identifies key results and  illustrative indicators for the main tasks. Specifically, the RFP suggests  metrics for reducing consumer demand, such as percentage of target  audience that receives the intended message and percentage change in  purchases of targeted illegal wildlife products. In addition, the RFP calls  for quarterly reports that must include, among other things, performance  indicator results against targets. USAID\u2019s RFP for Wildlife Asia also  designed monitoring into the program from the start by including similar  elements.\nIn May 2017, USAID produced an Activity Monitoring, Evaluation and  Learning Plan for Saving Species (MEL Plan), which includes a Results  Framework that identifies the purpose of the program and details  associated tasks and key results. According to the MEL Plan, the Results  Framework was developed based on a range of inputs, including USAID\u2019s  Measuring Efforts to Combating Wildlife Crime \u2013 A Toolkit for Improving  Action and Accountability. The MEL Plan also provides a mix of output  and outcome performance indicators with baselines and targets, to be  used for communication and decision making. In addition, the MEL Plan  calls for Pause and Reflect Sessions, Annual Strategic Reviews, work  planning sessions, and other key learning events to reflect on progress  and use that knowledge to adapt accordingly. In May 2017, USAID also  produced a draft MEL Plan for Wildlife Asia, which provides performance  indicators with baselines and targets. In addition, the April 2017 draft MEL  Plan for the Philippines Protect Wildlife program contains similar  information and, according to USAID officials, the MEL Plan used the  action and accountability toolkit to inform the development of CWT  metrics.\n\n\t\tOne Evaluation of CWT Activities Has Been Conducted by USAID\n\nOne USAID CWT program in Asia conducted a midterm evaluation, but  State and FWS have not conducted any evaluations. State has not  conducted any evaluations of INL CWT activities because none meet  State\u2019s criteria for completing an evaluation, including funding and  duration thresholds, according to a State official. FWS has not conducted  any evaluations of its CWT activities in Asia but has established a new  CWT-focused branch, which is developing a strategic plan, a framework,  and indicators to measure progress and success for CWT efforts. In  March 2016, the Task Force released an annual progress report that  describes U.S. government accomplishments; however, according to an  official, the Task Force does not plan to issue a progress report in 2017  due to vacancies in leadership and because agencies are working on a  similar report planned for completion sometime in 2017, in response to  the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016.\nUSAID\u2019s Evaluation Policy states that for each project, consideration will  be given during the design phase to the performance evaluation that will  be undertaken. The ARREST program conducted a midterm evaluation,  and we assessed it against key elements to determine the quality of the  evaluation. We have previously reported that addressing or requiring  certain elements provides the basis for a high-quality evaluation. For  this analysis, we considered a range of criteria, including the following:\nEvaluation questions align with program goals.\nTarget population and sampling method are appropriate, given the  scope and nature of the evaluation questions.\nData collection is appropriate for answering the evaluation questions.\nData analysis is appropriate to answer the evaluation questions.\nWe found that overall, the midterm evaluation was acceptable in quality,  although it fell short of fully addressing all the key elements. For example,  the evaluation generally met the first two elements above. However, the  evaluation only partially met the element for data collection and data  analysis. For example, the evaluation did not clearly specify how survey  recipients had been selected and did not provide precise details about  how qualitative data from in-person interviews had been analyzed. USAID  did not conduct a final evaluation of ARREST because, according to  officials, the timing of a late midterm evaluation was such that its findings  were used in the development of the new Wildlife Asia program, and it  would not have been cost-effective to conduct a final evaluation, among  other reasons.\nThe draft Wildlife Asia MEL Plan identifies plans to prepare for a midterm  and final performance evaluation at the middle and end of the program  time line, and USAID officials confirmed that they intend to conduct  evaluations of the program. The Saving Species MEL Plan indicates that  program officials will work in collaboration with USAID to conduct a  midterm evaluation and that one objective will be to provide  recommendations in order to improve effectiveness and evaluate factors  that help or hinder the achievement of expected outcomes and objectives.  The MEL Plan also calls for a third-party firm, identified by USAID through  a competitive process, to conduct the evaluation in the third year of the  program. The draft Philippines Protect Wildlife MEL Plan indicates that  the program will conduct a midterm and final evaluation.\n\n\t\tFWS, State, and USAID Have Identified and Applied Some Lessons Learned\n\nFWS, State, and USAID guidance states that agencies should learn from  monitoring and evaluation efforts so they can identify what works, what  does not work, and why. For example, from monitoring the first year of  implementation, FWS learned from its domestic campaign that most  Americans consider themselves wildlife lovers, but most know little about  wildlife trafficking, indicating the need for outreach and education efforts.\nState officials told us that they took stock of regional CWT activities in  Asia to improve program planning. As a result, before launching the next  set of CWT courses, INL is conducting a needs assessment to clarify skill  gaps, impact potential, and alignment with other activities. In addition, INL  is examining approaches to strengthen sustainability such as adding  train-the-trainer courses.\nUSAID and implementing partner officials told us that they learned  lessons during the implementation of ARREST and applied or plan to  apply them to new programs. For example, in response to ARREST\u2019s  midterm evaluation recommendation to focus demand reduction efforts  increasingly on behavior change communication, officials stated that they  adjusted the message of their campaign advertisements to target  behavior change and worked to recruit a range of key opinion leaders to  maximize reach and impact. USAID intends to carry this lesson over to its  new regional program, according to 2016 plans that call for the use of  behavior change communication methodologies, as opposed to one-off  public relations campaigns, in demand reduction activities. Officials told  us that in practice this means future campaigns will focus on specific  species, such as pangolins, and target Chinese and Vietnamese  consumers who believe pangolin scales can help with lactation. USAID\u2019s  implementing partner for Saving Species also identified possible ways to  improve the impact and sustainability of CWT training. For example,  instead of providing traditional, onetime classroom training, officials plan  to establish mentoring and on-the-job training programs in which officials  in similar roles teach one another. This facilitates learning and may help  identify CWT champions, enhancing sustainability and effectiveness,  according to program officials.\n\n\tConclusions\n\nWildlife trafficking, worth at least an estimated $7 billion annually,  continues to push some protected and endangered animal species to the  brink of extinction. Although agencies have worked together to combat  wildlife trafficking, as outlined in the National Strategy for Combating  Wildlife Trafficking Implementation Plan, disagreement on roles and  responsibilities has hindered some CWT activities in Southeast Asia. We  have previously reported that key issues agencies should consider  include whether participating agencies have clarified the roles and  responsibilities of participants in collaborative efforts and whether  participating agencies have agreed to a process for making and enforcing  decisions. Agencies have collaborated on a range of CWT activities,  including building law enforcement capacity, raising awareness, and  helping spur partner-nation action on CWT. While agencies have applied  some practices that can enhance and sustain collaborative efforts, such  as establishing joint strategies and defining a common outcome, some  officials in Southeast Asia reported a level of disagreement on roles and  responsibilities, resulting in the delivery of inappropriate training activities  and in the hindering of U.S. efforts to cooperate with a foreign  government. DOI, State, and USAID are members of the Presidential  Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking that is charged with coordinating  among agencies combating wildlife trafficking efforts. By ensuring that all  relevant member agencies have agreed on and clearly defined roles and  responsibilities, agencies will have more reasonable assurance that they  can effectively marshal the contributions of all agencies to take full  advantage of their expertise and resources in addressing CWT issues.  Taking steps to clarify specific roles and responsibilities, for example by  including them in a CWT country strategy or other document, could help  improve coordination, help ensure activities are mutually reinforcing,  reduce the risk of fragmented efforts, and maximize the impact of CWT  activities in Southeast Asia.\n\n\tRecommendations for Executive Action\n\nGAO is making the following three recommendations:\nThe Secretary of the Interior should work with the Task Force to clarify  roles and responsibilities of mission staff engaged in collaborative  efforts on combating wildlife trafficking in Southeast Asia.  (Recommendation 1)\nThe Secretary of State should work with the Task Force to clarify roles  and responsibilities of mission staff engaged in collaborative efforts on  combating wildlife trafficking in Southeast Asia. (Recommendation 2)\nThe Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development  should work with the Task Force to clarify roles and responsibilities of  mission staff engaged in collaborative efforts on combating wildlife  trafficking in Southeast Asia. (Recommendation 3)\n\n\tAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\n\nWe provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the  Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, the Interior, Justice,  State, and the Treasury, and USAID. The Departments of the Interior and  State and USAID agreed with our recommendations, and their comments  are reproduced in appendixes III, IV, and V, respectively. The  Departments of Commerce, the Interior, Justice, and State and USAID  provided us with technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.\nIn its comments, USAID indicated that it objects to the phrase \u201cbad  outcomes\u201d, the word \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and the description related to an  implementing partner that may have \u201coverstepped\u201d as used in our  discussion of agency collaboration. We attribute that language specifically  to certain agency officials, acknowledge differences in agency views, and  include perspectives from USAID officials for balance.\nIn its comments, DOI notes that that the content in the report that most  directly substantiates the recommendations occasionally reads as  disagreements involving a few specific activities among a small number of  U. S. government personnel. Our findings focus on a limited set of people  and activities but reflect a clear opportunity to clarify roles and  responsibilities. Moreover, as we mention, the mission in Bangkok  coordinates CWT activities across the Southeast Asia region, so efforts to  improve collaboration potentially would have a broad effect and benefit.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and to the Secretaries of Commerce, Homeland Security, the  Interior, State, and the Treasury; the Attorney General of the United  States; the Administrator of USAID. In addition, the report is available at  no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov.\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-8612, or gianopoulosk@gao.gov. Contact points for our  Offices of Congressional Relations and of Public Affairs may be found on  the last page of this report. GAO staff who made major contributions to  this report are listed in appendix VI.\n\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\n\nThis report examines (1) what is known about the demand for illegal  wildlife and wildlife products in the United States and in Asia, (2) actions  agencies are taking to reduce demand for illegal wildlife products in the  United States and Asia, and (3) the extent to which the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service (FWS) within the Department of the Interior (DOI), the  U.S. Department of State (State), and the U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID) are assessing the effectiveness of their combating  wildlife trafficking (CWT) activities.\nWe limited the scope of this review to the United States and Asia\u2014 identified as major markets for the illegal wildlife demand\u2014to complement  our 2016 report and to provide geographical diversity in our work. We  selected these geographic areas based on our review of reports on  demand for illegally traded wildlife and discussions with U.S. government  agencies.\nTo address our objectives, we analyzed agency documentation and met  with officials from DOI, State, USAID, the Department of Justice, and the  Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, which have designated roles in the National Strategy for  Combating Wildlife Trafficking Implementation Plan to lead or participate  in efforts to reduce illegal wildlife demand; the Department of Homeland  Security, which has a role in enforcement and capacity-building efforts;  and nongovernmental organizations (NGO) that focus on combating  wildlife trafficking. We conducted fieldwork in Miami, Florida; China; Hong  Kong; Thailand; and Vietnam. We selected these locations using a  combination of criteria: (1) Since fiscal year 2014, the location has  received at least $1 million in U.S. government funding for efforts related  to CWT; (2) CWT activities are under way in the location; and (3) the  location has the presence of at least two U.S. government agencies  conducting CWT work. This sample is not generalizable to all the  locations in which the United States has CWT-related programs.\nWhile in each location in Asia, we interviewed officials who played a role  in CWT activities, which included officials from State, USAID, and the  Departments of Homeland Security and the Interior. We also interviewed  officials from host governments responsible for the management of  natural resources and parks and representatives from NGOs, some of  which were involved in implementing U.S. government programs related  to awareness raising, law enforcement, and other CWT objectives.\nTo describe what is known about the demand for illegal wildlife and  wildlife products in the United States and in Asia, we reviewed reports on  wildlife trafficking produced by United Nations organizations, the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and NGOs  about the demand for these products in our locations of interest. We also  reviewed surveys conducted for programs partially or fully funded by U.S.  agencies that asked questions about purchasing behaviors for these  products in the United States, China, Vietnam, and Thailand. These  reports were either recommended to us by officials we interviewed or had  been identified during our prior work on the supply of wildlife products.  We reviewed the methodologies described in the reports and surveys and  determined they were sufficiently reasonable for providing examples of  wildlife and wildlife products traded and consumed and drivers for  consumption in China and countries in Southeast Asia. However, it was  beyond the scope of this review to determine the reliability of the  underlying data. Many of these reports depend heavily on seizure data,  which have limitations. The amount and location of seizures depend on  law enforcement efforts, efficacy of law enforcement efforts, presence of  illicit trade, and other factors, which are difficult to isolate.\nAdditionally, we analyzed national seizure data from the FWS\u2019s Law  Enforcement Management Information System to report on wildlife  confiscated in the United States. To assess the reliability of these data,  we interviewed agency officials, reviewed documentation about the data,  and conducted basic logical tests. We reviewed the 42,100 seizure  records that FWS provided for logical consistency and removed a few  hundred records for which we found duplicative, unknown, or blank  values. Overall, we determined the data are sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of identifying wildlife products seized between fiscal years 2007  and 2016. Data on seizures may not be indicative of underlying trends in  trade and consumption, as they are dependent upon factors such as  enforcement and techniques used by those importing the goods. To  gather perspectives on demand for illegally traded wildlife in China and  Southeast Asia, during our field visits to China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and  Vietnam, we interviewed officials from DOI, State, USAID, the  Department of Homeland Security, and officials at foreign ministries,  NGOs that are implementing partners for U.S. agencies or have  cooperated with U.S. agencies on CWT activities, and one company. We  interviewed the company for illustrative purposes.\nTo examine actions agencies are taking to reduce demand for illegal  wildlife products in the United States and Asia, we interviewed relevant  officials and reviewed information, including agency and implementing  partner documentation of CWT-related projects, programs, and grants.  We also analyzed how agencies combating wildlife trafficking in  Southeast Asia are applying selected practices that can enhance and  sustain collaborative efforts. As we have previously reported, such  practices include establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies,  defining and articulating a common outcome, and agreeing on roles and  responsibilities. In addition, we conducted fieldwork at the Port of Miami  and interviewed U.S. government officials at this location to obtain  insights on U.S. government activities. We selected the Port of Miami  because it has been the site of large-scale CWT operations, and agency  officials identified Miami as a hub for wildlife trade and an illustrative  example of U.S. government CWT operations. We also conducted  fieldwork in China and Vietnam, where we visited rescue centers and  interviewed host government officials and NGO representatives.\nTo examine the extent to which FWS, State, and USAID are assessing  the effectiveness of their CWT activities, we selected programs to  analyze, spoke with agency officials, and reviewed documentation from  the programs selected. We included programs that had started, finished,  or been ongoing from the beginning of fiscal year 2015 to the end of fiscal  year 2016 and that are or were solely dedicated to CWT. Specifically for  State, programs must have been identified by its Bureau of International  Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs as a discrete activity that  contributed to CWT and must have been at least 3 months into  implementation. Specifically for USAID, programs must have (or have  had) funding greater than $1 million. To assess agency monitoring  practices, we analyzed agency guidance on monitoring and examined  selected programs as illustrative examples of how agencies applied their  own guidance. To assess evaluation practices, we assessed a USAID  midterm evaluation against key elements to determine quality. Two  social science analysts independently assessed this evaluation using the  same criteria, methods, and procedures that we developed for  GAO-17-316. The analysts met and reconciled any initial differences in  their assessments.\nWe conducted this performance audit from October 2016 to October 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\n\nAppendix II: Photographs Related to Combating Wildlife Trafficking in the United States and Asia\n\nThe following photographs (see fig. 8-26) were taken by GAO staff during  field visits to Miami, Florida; Beijing, China; Hong Kong; Bangkok,  Thailand; and Hanoi, Vietnam.

    "output": "Why GAO Did This Study\n\nWildlife trafficking\u2014illegal trade in wildlife\u2014is estimated to be worth $7 billion to $23 billion annually and, according to State, continues to push some protected and endangered animal species to the brink of extinction. In 2013, President Obama issued an executive order that established an interagency Task Force charged with developing a strategy to guide U.S. efforts to combat wildlife trafficking.\nGAO was asked to review U.S. agencies' CWT efforts. GAO's September 2016 report on wildlife trafficking focused on supply side activities ( GAO-16-717 ). This report focuses on demand side activities and examines, among other things, (1) what is known about the demand for illegal wildlife and wildlife products in the United States and in Asia and (2) actions agencies are taking to reduce demand for illegal wildlife products in the United States and in Asia. GAO reviewed information from U.S. agencies and international and nongovernmental organizations and interviewed U.S. officials in Washington, D.C., and Miami, Florida, and U.S. and foreign government officials in China, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nIn the United States, China, and countries in Southeast Asia, there is diverse demand for illegally traded wildlife, according to data, reports, and various officials. The Department of the Interior's (Interior) U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has seized a variety of wildlife at U.S. ports, such as coral for aquariums, conch meat for food, seahorses for medicinal purposes, and crocodile skin for fashion items. In China and Southeast Asian countries, reports and officials have identified seizures and consumption of illegally traded wildlife products such as rhino horn, elephant ivory, pangolins (shown below), turtles, and sharks, among others, used for purposes such as food, decoration, pets, or traditional medicine.\nU.S. agencies are taking actions designed to reduce demand for illegal wildlife, including building law enforcement capacity and raising awareness, but disagreement on roles and responsibilities has hindered some combating wildlife trafficking (CWT) activities in Southeast Asia. FWS inspects shipments in the United States and facilitates law enforcement capacity building with partner nations overseas. The Department of State (State) conducts diplomatic efforts, some of which contributed to a joint announcement by China and the United States to implement restrictions on both countries' domestic ivory trade. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) works with local organizations abroad to support programs intended to reduce wildlife demand, strengthen regional cooperation, and increase law enforcement capacity. Several other agencies also contribute expertise or resources to support various demand reduction activities. Certain practices can enhance and sustain collaborative efforts, such as establishing joint strategies, defining a common outcome, and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. GAO found that agencies applied the first two practices but could improve with regard to agreement on roles and responsibilities in Southeast Asia. For example, although the National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking Implementation Plan designates various Task Force agencies to lead or participate in achieving CWT strategic priorities, it does not define specific roles and responsibilities at the working level. Agencies have different views on roles and responsibilities in Southeast Asia. According to some officials, this disagreement resulted in inappropriate training activities and hindered U.S. cooperation with a host nation. More clearly defining roles and responsibilities would enhance agency collaboration.\n\nWhat GAO Recommends\n\nGAO recommends that Interior, State, and USAID work to clarify roles and responsibilities for staff collaborating on combating wildlife trafficking efforts in Southeast Asia. Agencies agreed with GAO's recommendations.",

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBackground\n\nCivil aviation in the United States can be generally divided into two broad  categories\u2014general aviation and commercial aviation. All civilian pilot  students undergo their initial pilot training in the general aviation sector,  which comprises all aviation activities other than military and commercial  airlines. Once hired in the commercial aviation sector for businesses that  carry passengers or cargo for hire or compensation, pilots may receive  additional, employer-specific training.\nFAA is responsible for regulating the safety of civil aviation in the United  States, including the administration of pilot certification (licensing) and  conducting safety oversight of pilot training. Regulations for initial pilot  training and certification are found in two parts of the Federal Aviation  Regulations\u2014pilot training requirements  and requirements for obtaining  a pilot school certificate.\nPilot training requirements: These regulations prescribe the minimum  training, knowledge, and experience requirements for acquiring a  private, commercial, or airline transport pilot certificate, and for  becoming a certificated flight instructor (CFI). Individual  flight  instructors can provide pilot training to individuals under these  regulations and the training is not subject to direct FAA oversight  beyond the initial flight instructor certification and subsequent  renewal.\nRequirements for obtaining a pilot school certificate: These  regulations prescribe requirements pilot schools must meet to obtain  an FAA certificate and the general operating rules applicable to a  school\u2019s holding a certificate. FAA-certificated schools are required to  meet prescribed standards with respect to training equipment,  facilities, student records, personnel, and curriculum. Schools\u2019 pilot  program curriculum can vary in content, but FAA provides core  training guidelines that schools must follow to receive a certificate. To  ensure safety, FAA requires its inspectors to conduct on-site  inspections of each FAA-certificated school at least once a year,  focusing on pilot school operations and training aircrafts\u2019  airworthiness.\nSchools that provide initial pilot training generally fall into three  categories: (1) collegiate aviation schools, (2) non-collegiate vocational  pilot schools, and (3) non-collegiate, instructor-based pilot schools.  Collegiate aviation schools that provide initial pilot training typically offer a  2- or 4- year undergraduate degree in an aviation-based major along with  the pilot certificates and ratings necessary to become a commercial pilot.  All pilot schools must comply with FAA\u2019s pilot training requirements, but  some may elect to become FAA-certificated as well. Instructor-based  schools offer flexible training environments where the training sequence  can be altered to meet specific students\u2019 needs and time commitments.  Upon completion of the training, the students can obtain pilot certificates  for which they were trained, as long as they pass FAA\u2019s tests. FAA-certificated vocational schools do not allow flexible training environments  as the training sequence outlined in the curriculum cannot be altered.  FAA requires annual inspections of these schools, unlike flight instructor- based schools.\nAs we have previously reported, it takes years of training to meet FAA\u2019s  certification and aeronautical experience qualifications to become an  airline pilot. Once cleared by a medical examination, an individual  may  obtain a medical certificate and a student pilot certificate from FAA. Pilot  students may then begin training, acquiring the knowledge and flight  training to obtain a private pilot certificate, instrument rating, commercial  pilot certificate, and multi-engine rating (see fig. 1).\nTo be eligible for hire as either a captain or first officer for an airline,  individuals must also obtain an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate in  addition to the other certificates and ratings. In July 2013, FAA began  requiring all first officers to have an ATP certificate, which requires 1,500  hours of flight experience. Pilots with fewer than 1,500 hours can obtain  a \u201crestricted-privileges\u201d ATP certificate (R-ATP), under which specific  academic training courses can count toward the required hours of total  flight time. FAA made this change for airline first officers following the  2009 Colgan Air Inc. crash in New York,   and subsequent legislation  that required FAA to modify, among other things, first officer  qualifications. In our 2014 report, FAA and industry stakeholders  estimated that it could take an additional 1 to 2 years for pilots coming out  of school to meet the 1,500 hour requirement.\nConsistent with airline representatives\u2019 views from our prior report,  regional airline association representatives have recently cited the revised  first officer training requirements and several other factors as contributing  to a tight pilot labor market. By increasing the minimum number of  required flight hours for a first officer, entry into the airline pilot profession  may take longer, which may decrease the pool of eligible pilots that  mainline and regional airlines can hire as a first officer. In addition, as we  previously reported, the civil aviation industry has been a historically  volatile industry because demand for air travel is sensitive to economic  conditions, as well as political, international, and even health-related  events. After several years of industry contraction during the 2007-2009  economic recession, demand for air travel has increased since 2012, and  FAA projects continued future growth. In addition, since 2014, pilot retirements have been increasing, further tightening the labor market,  according to one study. That study forecasts between 2,000 and 3,000  annual mandatory age retirements from the mainline airlines between  2018 and 2021. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, most of the  newly hired pilots in the next 10 years will be replacing retiring pilots.\n\n\tWhile Some Information on Collegiate Aviation Schools\u2019 Pilot Degree Programs Is Available, Enrollment and Graduation Data are Limited\n\n\t\tCollegiate Aviation Schools Are Located across the Country and Offer Different Types of Pilot Degree Programs\n\nWe identified 147 U.S. colleges and universities that offered at least one  professional pilot degree program in academic year 2015-2016. These  collegiate aviation schools are located throughout the country, as shown  in figure 2. They may offer pilot programs within different academic  departments, such as aviation or business. Within a department, pilot  programs may be offered as a stand-alone program, as an integral part of  a larger major, such as flight education or aviation management, or as a  specialty or track within a major.\nProfessional pilot degree programs at collegiate aviation schools may  vary in several ways:\nSchool type: About three-quarters of collegiate aviation schools are  public (110 out of 145), while the remainder are either private non- profits or private for-profits, according to Education\u2019s data (see fig.  3).\nProgram degree length: A majority of collegiate aviation schools offer  4-year degree programs, as shown in figure 3. Program degree length  may affect how long it takes pilot students to meet FAA\u2019s  requirements and their career options once they complete training.  For example, pilot students in 2-year degree programs may complete  the program and acquire a commercial pilot certificate and ratings in  less time than the 4-year degree program, which may save the  students time and money. However, according to associations  representing pilot training providers and pilots, mainline airlines prefer  pilots with a 4-year degree. In addition, representatives from one  mainline airline told us that the airline requires a 4-year degree for  employment as a pilot. Regardless of which school and degree  program a pilot student graduates from, all pilot students must pass  the same knowledge and flight tests to obtain pilot certificates and  are, by FAA\u2019s standards, eligible for the same career opportunities.\nFAA Regulations and academic curriculum: Forty-six collegiate  aviation schools we identified operate their pilot programs solely  under FAA\u2019s pilot training requirements. The remaining 101 collegiate  aviation schools\u2019 pilot programs are certificated by FAA under FAA\u2019s  pilot school requirements. As previously discussed, FAA-certificated  schools must meet prescribed standards, have structured programs,  and FAA must approve their pilot program\u2019s curriculum. In addition,  each pilot program\u2019s academic curriculum may differ, though all must  meet FAA\u2019s pilot training requirements and, if the school is  certificated, FAA\u2019s pilot school requirements.\nR-ATP authorization: Only FAA-certificated collegiate aviation schools  may apply to FAA for authority to certify eligible graduates for an R- ATP certificate with a reduced number of flight hours. Since FAA  promulgated the new first officer qualification rule and established the  R-ATP certificate in 2013, FAA has issued R-ATP authorizations to  more schools each year. As of August 22, 2017, 86 collegiate aviation  schools hold R-ATP authorizations. In addition, the number of R-ATP  certificates FAA has issued to eligible graduates each year has  steadily increased, from 37 in 2013 to 2,190 in 2016. The number of  R-ATP certificates issued in 2016 represented about 18 percent of all  ATP certificates. The reduced flight-hour eligibility may save students  time and money on their path to becoming a professional pilot,  depending on how they gain flight experience, which may motivate  more students to consider attending collegiate aviation schools that  are authorized for R-ATP certificates, compared to other training  alternatives.\nAviation Accreditation Board International accreditation: Schools\u2019  professional pilot programs may choose to pursue program  accreditation in addition to the school\u2019s institutional accreditation.  Thirty-two collegiate aviation schools we identified have pilot  programs accredited by the Aviation Accreditation Board International  and an additional 4 schools have pilot programs that are candidates  for accreditation, as of December 27, 2017.\nThe collegiate aviation schools we identified require that students  complete training that includes both classroom (ground) and flight  training. Ground school aims to provide students with the required  aeronautical knowledge and cognitive skills necessary to perform the  tasks required to become a pilot. Flight training focuses on teaching how  to manipulate the controls of and safely operate an airplane. Most schools  (89 of 147) conduct their own flight training using university-owned or \u2013 leased aircraft and university employed CFIs (in-house flight training).  The number of CFIs employed by collegiate aviation schools varies and is  one of the primary determinants of a school\u2019s enrollment capacity. The  remaining 58 schools contract out their flight training to one or more pilot  schools or allow students to complete their flight training at a pilot school  of the student\u2019s choosing.\nSchools that provide in-house flight training operate at a relatively small  number of all domestic airports, which vary greatly in size as measured  by annual passenger enplanements (see fig. 4). Approximately 69  percent of these schools operate at non-primary airports\u2014those with  fewer than 10,000 passenger enplanements a year. Flight training may  comprise a large proportion of an airport\u2019s activity, particularly at smaller  airports, according to representatives from seven schools and two airport  authorities. The remaining 28 percent of the schools that provide in-house  flight training operate at primary airports with over 10,000 passenger  enplanements a year. There are advantages to operating at small and  large airports. Representatives from three schools and five stakeholders  representing flight training providers, airports, and pilots told us that  operating out of smaller airports may be advantageous because they are  less crowded, a condition that can save waiting time for take-offs and  allows students to practice certain maneuvers that may be more difficult  to perform at larger airports. Conversely, according to representatives  from two schools, two pilot training provider associations, and one airport,  operating at larger airports can be advantageous because students can  learn to fly in the controlled environment that airline pilots will eventually  fly in.\n\n\t\tPilot Student Enrollment and Graduation Data Are Limited\n\nFor several reasons, there are no comprehensive data on pilot student  enrollment at collegiate aviation schools. First, because non-certificated  schools are not subject to periodic FAA inspections, FAA does not collect  any enrollment data for these schools. Second, enrollment data are  available for only some FAA-certificated schools because reporting that  data is optional for those schools during FAA\u2019s certification and inspection  process. In addition, FAA does not verify the data to determine their  accuracy. As previously noted, FAA is responsible for regulating the  safety of civil aviation in the United States. As such, according to FAA  officials, FAA requires data collection when such a requirement serves a  safety purpose, such as data required for pilot school certification and  FAA oversight. FAA officials told us that other data on collegiate aviation  schools, such as enrollment numbers, do not serve FAA\u2019s primary safety  purpose.\nThe size of collegiate aviation schools appears to vary greatly. Although  voluntary, almost all FAA-certificated collegiate aviation schools  submitted enrollment data to FAA. According to FAA\u2019s data provided to us  on October 5, 2017, 92 FAA-certificated schools had reported average  yearly enrollment data for their pilot programs. Reported enrollment at  these FAA-certificated collegiate aviation schools varied greatly\u2014from 5  professional pilot students to 850. Despite this wide range, most (66) of  these schools reported that they enrolled 100 students or less in their pilot  programs. A majority (15 of 18) of representatives from selected  collegiate aviation schools noted an increase in enrollment over the past  5 years.\nAdditionally,  the data on graduations from professional pilot programs are  not comprehensive. Education requires schools, including collegiate  aviation schools, to report how many students they graduate annually.  School officials classify and report completed degrees by program type to  Education using the agency\u2019s classification system. One of Education\u2019s  program codes\u2014for \u201cAirline/Commercial/Professional Pilot and Flight  Crew\u201d\u2014appears to best capture graduates from professional pilot  programs. Education\u2019s data for professional pilot degrees awarded by  collegiate aviation schools under this code totaled 1,356 in academic year  2015\u20132016. However, of the 147 collegiate aviation schools we identified  for academic year 2015\u20132016, 72 reported pilot student graduates using  the code. This might be because collegiate aviation schools may report  their pilot student graduates under other program codes, such as  \u201cAeronautics/Aviation/Aerospace  Science and Technology, General\u201d and  \u201cAviation/Airway  Management and Operations.\u201d According to an  Education official, while the agency expects schools to provide precise  reporting of graduations from each degree program, he said it is possible  that some school officials may not perceive their programs consistently  with Education\u2019s program classifications, despite specific definitions for  each program category. Because pilot student graduates could be  reported under a number of aviation-related program codes in  Education\u2019s system, the number of professional pilot graduates could be  higher.\nAccording to Education\u2019s data, the number of professional pilot degrees  awarded by collegiate aviation schools under the  Airline/Commercial/Professional Pilot and Flight Crew code fluctuated  from year to year between academic year 2010\u20132011 and 2015\u20132016.  Almost half of the representatives from our selected collegiate aviation  schools (8 of 18) noted increased pilot student graduations over the past  5 years. The number of these graduations could continue to increase in  the next few years since, according to representatives from seven  schools, student enrollment generally responds to industry need and the  perception of a more stable career pathway. According to one of these  representatives, graduations increase with a lag relative to the increased  industry demand and student enrollment, given the time it takes to  complete the degree program. Given the observations from school  representatives of increasing enrollment, graduations may continue to  increase as well.\n\n\tFlight Instructor Turnover, Cost of Training, and Other Factors Affect Collegiate Aviation Schools\u2019 Ability to Produce Pilots\n\n\t\tRetaining Flight Instructors Is a Key Challenge for Collegiate Aviation Schools\u2019 Ability to Produce Pilots\n\nSelected school and other aviation industry representatives we spoke  with generally agreed that retaining and recruiting flight instructors is one  of the key challenges facing collegiate aviation schools.  Representatives from nearly all (16 of 18) of the schools identified  recruiting and retaining flight instructors as a great or moderate challenge  and a majority stated that it was their greatest challenge affecting their  ability to produce pilots (see app. I for a summary of the responses.).  According to representatives from 3 aviation industry stakeholders, in the  current environment some schools are unable to recruit and retain  enough flight instructors to train all the pilots that they otherwise have the  resources to accommodate in their pilot programs. To illustrate,  representatives from 2 schools reported an inability to accept some  qualified students because they did not have sufficient flight instructors.\nMeanwhile, representatives from 4 other schools said they have been  able to hire enough new instructors to keep up with flight instructor  attrition. In addition to presenting a management challenge, instructor  turnover may hinder training effectiveness. For example, one pilot  association representative told us that the quality of instruction tends to  be lower when students are routinely subject to new instructors since  there is little instructional continuity.\nRepresentatives of 6 of the collegiate aviation schools we interviewed  said they recognize that instructor turnover is unavoidable because most  pilots do not pursue flight instruction as a long-term career. Regardless,  the rate of turnover in recent years has increased, according to selected  school and other aviation industry representatives. As previously  discussed, school representatives told us that most pilots use flight  instruction as a stepping stone to accrue the required flight time to  become an airline pilot, which commands a higher salary and greater  prestige than flight instructor positions. Flight instructors generally seek  employment with an airline as soon as they are eligible, according to most  school representatives (15 of 18) and other stakeholders we spoke with.  According to two aviation industry stakeholder representatives, the career  progression of civilian-trained pilots from flight instructor to commercial  airline pilot has typically worked in this way. However, stakeholders have  stated that in recent years, airline industry growth, increasing pilot  retirements, and other factors previously discussed have caused  commercial airlines to accelerate pilot recruitment, ultimately causing  pilots to move through the instructor ranks more quickly.\nRegional airlines now hire qualified pilots as soon as they accrue the  minimum hours required by FAA, according to representatives from one  airline pilots association. According to one study, in the mid-2000s most  of the larger regional airlines set minimum flight-hour requirements for  first officer applicants of 800 to 1,000 hours, which were well above the FAA requirements at the time. Furthermore, applicants needed an even  higher number of hours to be competitive for those positions prior to that  time\u2014between 1,500 and 2,000 hours, according to representatives of a  pilots\u2019 association.\nRecruiting and retaining flight instructors with more advanced  qualifications, such as instructors qualified to train other pilots to be flight  instructors and chief instructors, can be a particular challenge for  collegiate aviation schools:\nFlight instructors qualified to train flight instructors: FAA requires flight  instructors to have a minimum 2 years of instructor experience before  they may train other pilots to obtain their CFI certificate.  Representatives from almost half (8 of 18) of collegiate aviation  schools reported challenges with retaining flight instructors long  enough for them to meet that requirement. According to some school  representatives, flight instructors typically accrue the minimum hours  required to qualify for their ATP or R-ATP within 2 years or soon  afterward. The resulting attrition of experienced flight instructors can  therefore hamper schools\u2019 ability to train enough pilots to become  flight instructors, an ability that is crucial for turning out the next  generation of instructors and pilot students.\nChief Instructors: FAA requires certificated schools to have a chief  instructor who meets minimum regulatory qualifications, such as at  least 2,000 hours of flight time as \u201cpilot-in\u2013command.\u201d  Representatives from two schools told us that because of high  instructor turnover, few instructors meet these qualifications and the  schools find it challenging to recruit qualified chief instructors.\nFour school representatives and two other aviation stakeholders we  interviewed noted that the revised first officer requirements have helped  collegiate aviation schools retain flight instructors. As previously  discussed, these revised requirements increased the minimum number of  flight hours a pilot must have to become a first officer, so instructors  continue to instruct longer than they might have otherwise. The school  representatives noted that while they are still experiencing high flight  instructor turnover the situation would be more challenging without the  new requirements. In addition, representatives from two large collegiate  aviation schools stated that when there is a high demand for pilots, they  would not be able to recruit and retain any flight instructors in the absence  of FAA\u2019s first officer requirements.\nAs shown in table 1, several of the collegiate aviation schools we  interviewed have taken some actions to address the challenge of  recruiting and retaining flight instructors.\nAt least 6 regional airlines offer cadet programs, which may provide  additional incentives for graduates to remain at their alma mater as flight  instructors until they meet FAA\u2019s first officer qualification requirements,  according to school representatives we spoke to. These programs may include incentives such as bonus pay for a number of flight hours, health  benefits, or tuition reimbursement. Students who sign onto the cadet  programs typically accept a provisional employment offer and are  expected to work for the airline upon obtaining the number of hours  necessary for the ATP certificate and completing an airline\u2019s new hire  training. Representatives from two schools said that few students  participated in these programs, attributing lower participation to students  who may not want to commit to one airline.\nIn addition to actions that schools can take to retain flight instructors,  school representatives suggested additional actions that would require  cooperation from airlines. Representatives from one state university told  us that the school negotiated an agreement with one airline to initially hire  its graduates as part-time pilots, allowing the pilots to continue to work  part-time as flight instructors. The school is attempting to go one step  further by negotiating agreements whereby airlines will not hire its  instructors until the school is ready to relinquish them. According to the  school\u2019s representatives, two regional airlines have recognized that  keeping instructors at the school longer could be to their benefit,  increasing the school\u2019s capacity to produce more pilots that the airlines  will then hire. Another school representative suggested that airlines might  consider loaning out their pilots to instruct for schools, but a  representative from an airline association said that airlines do not have  extra personnel to spare. Representatives of a pilot school said they are  working with airlines to change the seniority system so that pilots can get  their seniority number while they are instructors, which could reduce the  strong incentive to become an airline pilot as quickly as possible.\nSchool representatives and a stakeholder described additional actions  that could be taken to address this issue, including encouraging students  to obtain their CFI, encouraging retired airline pilots to instruct, and  raising the profile of the flight instructor profession as a possible career  path. Collegiate aviation schools may require their students to obtain a  CFI to graduate. Those schools that do not require a CFI may produce  fewer graduates who are qualified to instruct. A representative from one  school told us that it is now encouraging students to obtain their CFI as a  way to increase the number of potential flight instructors. Representatives  from three industry associations said the FAA should consider changing  its requirement for instructors to have 2 years instructing experience  before they may train other pilots to obtain their CFIs. In addition, in 2017  the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee issued a report  recommending that FAA permit completion of an FAA-approved  standardized course at FAA-certificated schools as an alternative to the  2-year experience requirement. According to FAA officials, the agency  is drafting a proposed regulatory change to allow appropriately qualified  flight instructors who have met proficiency requirements to train other  pilots to obtain a CFI.\n\n\t\tThe Cost of Flight Training Is a Challenge for Some Colleges in Recruiting and Retaining Students\n\nThere was general agreement among the majority of school  representatives we interviewed that in the last 5 years more students  have shown interest in the pilot profession by applying for and enrolling in  pilot programs at collegiate aviation schools. Representatives from eight  schools and one aviation industry stakeholder noted that students may be  interested in becoming pilots because there appears to be more pilot  career opportunities and a greater likelihood of a secure and lucrative  career path. Some airlines have created career path programs that  document the requirements to move along the career path from pilot  school to a particular regional airline and on to a particular mainline  airline. According to an association representing pilots, they have done so  to encourage more students to enter the pilot profession. Nonetheless,  representatives from nearly all schools we interviewed identified the cost  of a professional pilot degree program as a great (10 schools) or a  moderate (6 schools) challenge to recruiting and retaining students.\nWhile high education costs are not unique to pilot programs, these  programs can be particularly expensive, and therefore unaffordable to  many students. As previously reported, professional pilot students incur  flight training \u201clab fees\u201d in addition to general college tuition and fees, that together often exceeds $100,000. Schools\u2019 tuition and fees can vary  significantly. Factors affecting cost include whether the school is public,  private non-profit, or private for-profit, whether the school offers a 2-year  or 4-year program, and the student\u2019s resident status. According to  Education\u2019s data, annual in-state tuition at public collegiate aviation  schools we identified ranges from approximately $1,100 to $13,000.  However, annual out-of-state tuition at a public 4-year program can cost  as much as approximately $28,800. Private school tuition can cost more.  For example, one 4-year private for-profit collegiate aviation school lists  estimated annual undergraduate tuition of nearly $36,000, not including  room and board or flight training costs.\nFlight training costs also vary considerably. According to the University  Aviation Association\u2019s 2016 directory of collegiate aviation schools, a  majority of pilot programs (27 of 45) have total approximate flight training  costs of more than $50,000, with an upper cost of about $81,000. Flight  training costs may vary, depending on the school requirements, student  interest, and aptitude. Pilot program curriculum may differ and some  students may choose to take additional classes. Each additional  certificate and rating adds to the total cost of the training. Also, the time  required for students to complete their certificates and ratings varies.  Compounding the issue of cost is that the maximum federal financial aid  available to eligible students is well below the full cost of a collegiate flight  education, a factor that is also not unique to collegiate aviation students.  For academic years 2017\u20132018 and 2018\u20132019, the maximum federal  Pell Grant award is currently $5,920, and annual federal loan limits range  from $5,500 up to $12,500 depending on the student\u2019s year in school,  dependency status, and other factors. Most students need to either use  family resources or take out private loans to pay for the total cost of a pilot  program, according to representatives from four schools. Not all students  have the means to do so, as private lenders may require a co-signer with  good credit and a minimum income level. Also, representatives from two  schools said that some students who initially secure private loans for flight  training are unable or unwilling to secure loans needed later on to  complete this training, causing them to leave the pilot program. This  financing challenge may pose a significant barrier for lower income  students to enter the pilot profession.\nThere are lower cost alternatives to collegiate aviation schools, though  they are not entirely equivalent. Students may obtain a flight education  and achieve the same FAA certificates and ratings from a non-collegiate  pilot school and incur flight training expenses without the added cost of  college tuition. As previously discussed, a pilot with non-collegiate flight  training could be eligible for the same employment opportunities with  regional airlines, but according to five stakeholders, airlines prefer or have  typically hired pilots with a 4-year degree. Military  service is another lower  cost alternative for flight training, as service members are compensated  for their time while they are training. However, one school representative  noted that service members may enlist in the military with the intention of  pursuing flight training, but they are not guaranteed to receive a flight  assignment.\nRepresentatives from two stakeholders told us it is not possible to  significantly reduce the cost of flight training because it is inherently  expensive, and four school representatives said that costs are  increasing. One approach to controlling costs for students is to make it  easier for them to transfer from public 2-year pilot programs to 4-year  programs, since public 2-year programs are typically less expensive. A  representative from a state university told us that he is developing a  degree completion program for professional pilot students from U.S. 2- year colleges. This program would enable students to complete their  bachelor\u2019s degree online with the university after they have obtained an  associate\u2019s degree in flight. Similarly, a community college has transfer  agreements with several 4-year universities, and most of its students aim  to obtain a 4-year college degree. We previously found that when  colleges provide their students with information on transfer agreements  they help students save on tuition costs by enabling students to predict which credits will transfer and reducing the likelihood that they will need to  repeat coursework. Two schools have opened satellite campuses for  their flight programs, and two other schools are considering that option,  both to expand their capacity and to provide options for students to  receive flight training while living closer to home, according to school  representatives.\nOther actions schools have taken focus on ensuring that students are  able to pay for the program and offering assistance with costs where  possible. Representatives of three schools told us that they are raising  money for departmental scholarships, and a representative of one school  said the school raises awareness about outside scholarships that may be  available to its students. A representative from a community college  said that there are scholarships available for women and minorities.  According to one industry representative, there are not enough women  and minorities in aviation, which will negatively affect the supply of future  pilots. One state university offers in-state tuition for flight students who  are residents of nearby states, with the aim of both reducing some  students\u2019 costs and increasing enrollment at the school. Representatives  of four schools told us that they emphasize communication with potential  students about costs before they enroll to improve pilot student retention.  In addition, one school we spoke with requires students to pay their flight  training fees for each certification upfront in one lump sum to ensure that  students will be able to complete the training.\nInitiatives to assist students with funding and reduce costs of flight  training have been in place for a long time with limited impact, according  to one flight training provider association. Other aviation stakeholders  noted that regional and mainline airlines could have a greater effect than  previous efforts by working together. For example, airlines could provide  scholarships and subsidize students\u2019 flight training while students are still  in school. The airlines could also work together as an industry to provide  scholarships to students. However, as one aviation association noted,  airlines are reluctant to provide scholarships to students who are likely to  fly for a competitor. Representatives from two stakeholders suggested that increases to limits on federal student loans could provide additional  resources to help students pay for flight training costs. To some extent  and even if additional actions are taken to help defray some of the  educational costs, some students may not be able to afford the cost of  collegiate aviation schools.\n\n\t\tA Variety of Other Factors May Present Challenges for Some Collegiate Aviation Schools\n\nSome selected school representatives also cited other challenges, though  these challenges were cited by fewer representatives, and most of the  representatives characterized these challenges as moderate or slight.\nPurchasing and maintaining aircraft. Representatives from 13 schools  said that purchasing or maintaining aircraft, or obtaining the requisite  purchase approvals can be challenging. New single-engine training  aircraft could cost more than $300,000, while a new multi-engine  aircraft can cost around $750,000. Purchasing older, used equipment  is one possible way to defray aircraft costs, but older equipment  requires more time offline for maintenance. Representatives from  two schools stated that aircraft used for training requires extensive  scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, which can interfere with  their ability to train students.\nAirport infrastructure and airspace constraints. When asked about  challenges related to airport infrastructure, representatives of six  schools identified challenges related to space constraints. Issues  included insufficient space to store and maintain aircraft, insufficient  classroom and office space, and crowded airspace that cannot  accommodate the desired flight operations to train the number of pilot  students they could with their existing resources. Few representatives  identified infrastructure availability at the airport as a great (1 school)  or moderate (3 schools) challenge, while 6 representatives reported  that infrastructure posed only a slight challenge and 7 said it was not  a challenge at all.\nVA education benefit program administration\u2014publication of specific  training hours and costs. Representatives from eight schools and two  stakeholders expressed some concern about new enforcement of VA  education benefit rules from the Post 9/11 GI Bill, as amended by the  Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of  2010. VA issued two policy advisories in 2015 to notify collegiate  aviation schools about statutory education benefit policies and bring  them into compliance. One policy advisory notified schools that they  must publish the specific number of training hours, as well as the  specific cost of training, for each flight course, effectively setting a  maximum number of training hours and fixed fees for each course  taken as part of a standard degree program. According to VA,  before the agency issued the policy advisories there was great public  and congressional outcry about individual pilot students receiving  hundreds of thousands of dollars from VA for their education. VA  issued the policy advisories to specify what pilot training activities are  appropriate uses of VA money, and under what circumstances. VA  funds cannot be used to pay for pilot training to proficiency because  that would entail an unlimited amount of funds to be available for an  individual\u2019s flight training.\nRepresentatives from five selected schools reported that this rule  made it difficult to provide efficient and effective flight training for all  pilot students. Depending on the program structure, students who  cannot finish the course in the set number of hours must either pay  out of pocket for additional training or accept a failing grade and take  the course again. VA education benefits pay for eligible beneficiaries  to repeat the course if needed. In contrast, FAA imposes a minimum  but not a maximum number of hours per certificate, because the  training goal is to achieve a certain level of proficiency for each  certificate. One school representative stated that the school allowed  its VA education benefit eligibility  to lapse because it allowed them the  freedom to train students to proficiency without maximum training  hours; however, veterans can no longer use their benefits to enroll in  that program.\nVA education benefit eligibility for contracted flight instruction.\nRepresentatives of two out of the five schools we interviewed that  contract out flight training and one stakeholder reported a challenge  concerning a rule described in the second VA policy advisory; the rule  places restrictions on collegiate aviation schools that contract out  flight training to a non-collegiate school. Previously, veterans  received benefits for flight training conducted at non-collegiate pilot  schools through the institution of higher learning that contracted out  the flight training. However, in its policy advisory VA stated that this  practice was not consistent with the rules of the education benefit  program because there are different rules for non-collegiate pilot  schools; VA benefits cannot be used to pay for training toward private  pilot certification at non-collegiate pilot schools. In addition, federal  law states that the VA cannot approve the enrollment of an eligible  veteran in a course if it involves contracted training that is either  otherwise barred from being approved or has not obtained approval  on its own.\nAs a result, to remain eligible for VA education benefits, a collegiate  aviation school cannot include private pilot certification training  provided by a non-collegiate pilot school in its degree program since  such training is statutorily barred from approval at the contracted non- collegiate pilot school. Therefore, all students enrolled in such  programs must have already earned their private pilot certificate  before matriculating in the program, whether they use veterans\u2019  education benefits or not. According to VA, it issued its policy advisory  to clarify the statutory limitations of education benefits under the GI  Bill relating to private pilot certificate courses. Representatives from  two schools said that they are currently not eligible for VA education  benefits as a result of this rule, which representatives of one school  said has affected the school\u2019s enrollment of veterans. Furthermore,  industry stakeholders have expressed concern about greater limits on  VA education benefits for flight training based on possible future  legislative action. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Transportation  has announced a new \u201cForces to Flyers Initiative\u201d  with two objectives:  (1) to assess the level of interest among veterans in becoming pilots  and (2) to help veterans who are not former military pilots to receive  the training they need to become commercial pilots. Though  representatives from five schools identified this issue as a great  challenge, overall its impact is limited because not all schools have  students using veterans\u2019 benefits for their pilot programs, and a small  percentage of students overall use veterans\u2019 benefits to pay for their  education.\n\n\tAgency Comments\n\nWe provided a draft of this product to the DOT, Education, and VA for  comment. DOT provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.  Education and VA declined to provide formal or technical  comments.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of the Department of Transportation, the  Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of the  Department of Education, and other interested parties.

Furthermore, we reviewed the Federal  Aviation Regulations related to training and certification for pilots under  Part 61 and Part 141. We also reviewed provisions of the Airline Safety  and Federal Aviation  Administration Extension Act of 2010 (Pub. L. No.  111-216) related to \u201cFlight Crewmember Screening and Qualifications\u201d  and \u201cAirline Transport Pilot Certification.\u201d\nTo determine what is known about collegiate aviation schools we  analyzed several sets of data and interviewed representatives from  collegiate aviation schools and other aviation stakeholders. To identify  colleges and universities with professional pilot degree programs for fixed  wing aircraft in academic year 2015\u20132016, we compared FAA\u2019s data on  FAA-certificated pilot schools as of August 19, 2016; the Aircraft Owner  and Pilot Association\u2019s list of colleges and universities with aviation  programs as of September 19, 2016; and the University Aviation  Association\u2019s 2016 directory of collegiate aviation schools. These data  were the most applicable given the academic year reviewed. We verified  schools on all three lists by checking school websites, typically the  program\u2019s webpage or course catalog detailing degree program  requirements. For schools that were included on only one or two of the  lists, two staff members independently reviewed school information and  categorized the school as inside or outside of our scope. Disagreements  between coders were reviewed by a third staff member and resolved  through discussion. In a few cases where website information was  unclear, the staff member contacted school officials to verify that they  offered a professional pilot degree program. To determine the airport and  airport types at which schools with professional pilot degree programs  operated their flight training, we reviewed information from FAA\u2019s National  Plan of Integrated Airport Systems, the Aircraft Owner and Pilot  Association, and school websites. We also selected and interviewed  representatives of six airports of varying types (e.g., medium-hub, small- hub, and non-hub) and in different geographic areas of the country, all of  whom had collegiate aviation school tenants. Because we selected the  airports as part of a nonprobability  sample, our findings cannot be  generalized to all airports with collegiate aviation school tenants.\nTo determine what is known about the institution type, college-wide tuition  and fees, and graduations at these schools, we analyzed data from  Education\u2019s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).  Of the 147 collegiate aviation schools with professional pilot degree  programs that we identified, 146 of them have an IPEDS identification  number. According to Education officials, schools with an IPEDS  identification number are likely to participate in Title IV financial aid, be  accredited, and consequently be monitored by Education through several  mechanisms including IPEDS, federal student aid compliance, and  accreditation. With respect the institution type, the categories of schools  included in our analysis included degree-granting institutions of the  following types: public, private non-profit, and private for profit with either  4-year baccalaureate or 2-year associates degrees. With respect to  tuition and fees, we reviewed both in-state and out-of-state costs schools  reported to Education. Data were not available for academic year 2014\u20132015 for two collegiate aviation schools we identified. In a few instances  schools offered lower-cost tuition and fees to local students (in-district).  For purposes of comparison, we did not include these costs in our report,  since not all schools offer in-district discounts. With respect to the  graduations data, we analyzed graduations data in academic year 2015\u2013 2016 in 10 aviation-related categories within Education\u2019s Classification of  Instructional Programs (CIP) for schools we identified as having  professional pilot degree programs. We determined that IPEDS data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives  based on prior testing of the data from these systems and interviews with  knowledgeable officials at Education\u2019s National Center for Education  Statistics.\nTo determine what is known about enrollment at collegiate aviation  schools, we analyzed enrollment and flight instructor data voluntarily  reported to FAA by some schools between October 2015 and October  2017. Through interviews with FAA officials, we have determined these  data were the most complete sources available and, while limited, were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of illustrating the variety in the size of  professional pilot degree program enrollment. We also obtained and  analyzed FAA\u2019s pilot certificate and instrument rating data to identify, for a  number of categories, the number of new pilot certificates FAA issued  from 2012 through 2016 and the total number of pilot certificate holders  for those years. One limitation associated with the database in which  FAA stores certificate-holder information is that the agency does not have  an active process in place to discover and deactivate deceased pilots.  This lack may lead to an over count in the number of active pilot  certificates. However, airline transport pilot certificate holders must  regularly renew their medical certificates to remain active. We found that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting the number  of \u201crestricted privileges\u201d airline transport pilot certificates FAA has issued  since 2013.\nTo determine challenges that affect collegiate aviation schools\u2019 ability to  produce professional pilots, we reviewed documents, interviewed, and  administered a standardized question set to a non-generalizable sample  of 18 collegiate aviation schools about their pilot programs and key  challenges that affect their ability to produce professional pilots. To select  our non-generalizable sample of schools, we used information from FAA,  the Aircraft Owner and Pilot Association, school websites, and initial  interviews with aviation stakeholders. Based on the schools\u2019 geographic  location, we selected schools in each of FAA\u2019s nine airport regions. In  order to provide a variety of perspectives in our selection, we included  schools of each institution type (public, private non-profit, and private for- profit), of each program type (2-year and 4-year), some that were FAA- certificated and some that contracted out flight training. While the sample  allowed us to learn about challenges that affect these schools\u2019 ability to  produce professional pilots, it was designed to provide anecdotal  information, not findings that would be representative of all collegiate  aviation schools with professional pilot degree programs in the United  States. Our initial selection included 20 schools, of which 19 responded to  our request for interview. Of these 19, 18 schools responded to our  question set, and representatives of one additional school provided us  with general information about their program.\nIn our question set, we asked schools to rate 10 factors that we identified  in preliminary interviews as potentially affecting schools\u2019 ability to recruit,  retain, and train professional pilot students\u2014thereby affecting their ability  to produce pilots. Schools rated each factor as a great challenge, a  moderate challenge, a slight challenge, or not a challenge to the ability to  recruit, retain, and train professional pilot students. After our interviews  with officials from the selected schools, we analyzed and aggregated  responses to these questions, and identified two factors that schools most  frequently cited as the most challenging to their ability to produce pilots.  In addition, 3 other factors were cited by multiple schools as a great or  moderate challenge. Schools generally cited the remaining 5 factors as a  slight or moderate challenge.\nTo describe stakeholders\u2019 views of factors that affect collegiate aviation  schools\u2019 ability to produce pilots and actions that have been or could be  taken to address these factors, we reviewed and summarized schools\u2019  comments. We also reviewed documents and interviewed FAA officials,  representatives of airports and industry organizations representing  collegiate and non-collegiate pilot schools, airports, flight instructors,  pilots, regional airlines, and mainline airlines, selected to reflect a range  of perspectives about initial pilot training. (See table 4.) In addition, we  reviewed documents and interviewed Education and Department of  Veterans Affairs officials about regulations and policies related to pilot  programs\u2019 eligibility  for federal student financial aid and the use of  veterans\u2019 education benefits.\nWe conducted this performance audit from September 2016 to May 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\n\nAppendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\n\n\tGAO Contact\n\n\tStaff Acknowledgments\n\nIn addition to the contact named above, Gerald Dillingham, Ph.D.  (Director); Vashun Cole (Assistant Director); Jaclyn Mullen (Analyst-in- Charge); Amy Abramowitz; Danielle Ellingston; Dave Hooper; Delwen  Jones; Serena Lo; John Mingus; Natasha Oliver; Malika Rice; Michelle St.  Pierre; and Elizabeth Wood made key contributions to this report.\n\nSummary:\n",
    "output": "Why GAO Did This Study\n\nCollegiate aviation schools are one pathway for initial civilian pilot training in the United States and are a key source of airline pilots. Over the past 5 years, aviation stakeholders have voiced concerns that there is an insufficient supply of qualified airline pilots, citing increased airline pilot retirements, among other factors.\nThe explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017 included a provision for GAO to review aspects of collegiate aviation schools' operations. This report examines: (1) what is known about schools with professional pilot degree programs and (2) challenges that affect schools' ability to produce professional pilots and schools' responses to these challenges.\nGAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and documents from the FAA, Veterans Affairs, and Education; analyzed FAA's data on flight schools, airports, and pilots; and analyzed Education's degree completion data for the 2015\u20132016 academic year, the most recent data available. GAO also interviewed representatives from: 18 schools, selected based on factors including program type and location; 6 airports selected based on type and location; and 11 additional aviation stakeholders representing schools, airlines, pilots, airports, and flight instructors, selected to reflect a range of perspectives about initial pilot training. The results of the interviews are not generalizable to all aviation schools and stakeholders. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. On a draft of the report, DOT provided technical clarifications, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nGAO identified 147 collegiate aviation schools that offered professional pilot degree programs in academic year 2015\u20132016. All pilot students must pass the same knowledge and flight tests to obtain pilot certificates from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), but schools' programs vary. For example, 101 of these schools operated relatively more formalized, FAA-certificated degree programs. The other 46 schools operated under a model that provides flexibility and meets FAA requirements but that does not require FAA certification to conduct such training. Total annual pilot-student enrollment and graduation numbers are not known. According to FAA officials, FAA does not require schools to submit enrollment data and does not verify enrollment data that many certificated schools voluntarily submit. Regarding graduation data, schools must classify and report completed degrees by program type to the Department of Education (Education) using that agency's classification system. Education's data indicated a total of 1,356 professional pilot degrees in academic year 2015\u20132016. Because pilot-student graduates can be classified under a number of aviation-related programs in Education's system, the number of pilot-student graduates could be higher.\nFlight instructor retention, which has been influenced by the current high demand for airline pilots, and the high cost of pilot training are key challenges that affect schools' ability to produce pilots, according to aviation stakeholders GAO interviewed.\nFlight instructor retention : Nearly all (16 of 18) selected school representatives cited difficulty recruiting and retaining flight instructors as a great or moderate challenge for schools' ability to train pilots. According to most school representatives (15) and other selected stakeholders, instructors who aspire to be airline pilots are rapidly accruing the flight hours necessary to qualify and are obtaining employment as soon as they are eligible. In addition, regional airlines have recently increased hiring, generating high turnover among flight instructors, who are traditionally their main source of new pilots.\nHigh cost of training : Nearly all (16) selected schools' representatives identified the cost of a professional pilot degree program as a great or moderate challenge to recruiting and retaining pilot students. High education costs are not unique to these programs. Nonetheless, in addition to tuition, flight training fees alone often exceed $50,000, well above the cap for federal financial aid available to eligible students.\nSchools and regional airlines have taken a range of actions to address these challenges. For example, eight selected school representatives reported increasing flight instructors' compensation and benefits. In addition, some regional airlines' cadet programs provide mentorship and incentives such as bonus pay or tuition reimbursement to select students while they are still in school. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has also launched an initiative to assess the level of interest among veterans in becoming pilots and to examine strategies for employing military veterans as pilots.",
