Until 1 April 1965, companies were taxed at the same income tax rates as individual taxpayers, with an additional profits tax levied on companies.

In 1973, alongside the introduction of advance corporation tax (ACT), Conservative chancellor Anthony Barber created a main rate of 52%, together with a smaller companies' rate of 42%. This apparent increase was negated by the fact that under the ACT scheme, dividends were no longer subject to income tax. The 1979 Conservative Budget of Geoffrey Howe cut the small companies' rate to 40%, followed by a further cut in the 1982 Budget to 38%. The Budgets of 1983\u20131988 saw sharp cuts in both main and small companies' rates, falling to 35% and 25% respectively.

Previously self-employed individuals could now distribute profits as dividend payments rather than salaries.

The fact that individuals operating in this manner could potentially pay no tax at all was felt by the government to be unfair tax avoidance, and the 2004 Budget introduced a Non-Corporate Distribution Rate.

The Uralic and Finnish languages have simple diminutives (-csa/i and -ka/e/i), but both variants can be found in the Hungarian language.\nDocument [8]: Alternative theories of the Hungarian language relations Current linguistic theory suggests that the Hungarian language belongs to the Finno-Ugric branch of the Uralic language family. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences supports this idea based on the harmony with the Indo-European language theory, and its scientific support worldwide. However, some expound alternative theories of the Hungarian language relations. Opponents of the Finno-Ugric theory put forward alternative theories in response to two principal problems: \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry published his work, the \"Magyar \u00e9s t\u00f6r\u00f6k-tat\u00e1r sz\u00f3egyeztet\u00e9sek\" (\"Hungarian and Turk-Tatar word concords\"), in 1869.

Stiernhelm commented on the similarities of Sami, Estonian and Finnish, and also on a few similar words between Finnish and Hungarian. These authors were the first to outline what was to become the classification of the Finno-Ugric, and later Uralic family.

Perhaps his most notable contribution has been to show that if long-run balance of payments equilibrium\nDocument [8]: Kaldor's model would lead us to conclude that the cycle might give way to either perpetual and rising inflation or stagnation. Kaldor's non-linear business cycle theory overcomes the difficulty that many economists had with Roy Harrod's growth theory. Many of the American Neo-Keynesian economists thought that Harrod's work implied that capitalism would tend toward extremes of zero and infinite growth and that there were no dynamics that might keep it in check. Robert Solow, who eventually created the Solow Growth Model in response to these perceived problems, summarised this view as such: In fact, Kaldor's 1940 paper had already shown\nDocument [9]: Sterling.

According to Lee's notes, Lee believed John Brown was a madman, \"... the plan [raiding the Harpers Ferry Arsenal] was the attempt of a fanatic or madman.\" Lee also believed that the blacks in the raid were forced by Brown. \"The blacks, whom he [John Brown] forced from their homes in this neighborhood, as far as I could learn, gave him no voluntary assistance.\" Lee attributed John Brown's \"temporary success\" by creating panic and confusion and by \"magnifying\" the number of participants involved in the raid.

At Harpers Ferry, Ashby was assigned to the Virginia Militia command of Colonel Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson, whom he had met at Harpers Ferry and Charles Town in 1859. Ashby was initially assigned to guard fords across the Potomac River and bridges from Harpers Ferry to Point of Rocks, Maryland. He became known for visiting his pickets on long horseback rides (50-miles while guarding the Potomac, later 70 miles when guarding Stonewall Jackson's rear during the Valley Campaign), as well as for interfering with scouting operations of\nDocument [10]: the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry. Major Jackson was placed in command of the artillery, consisting of two howitzers manned by 21 cadets. In response to the raid on Harper's Ferry, Governor Wise ordered Gilham to write a manual to train volunteers and militia. Finished in the fall of 1860, it was entitled \"Manual of Instruction for the Volunteers and Militia of the United States\" and was initially published in Philadelphia. According to VMI records, while residing in Lexington, Major Gilham and his wife Cordelia Adelaide Hayden Gilham (1826\u20131913) had 7 children, 3 born after moving to Virginia.

Clement's contemporary Tertullian rejects the accusation that Christians are \"crucis religiosi\" (i.e. \"adorers of the gibbet\"), and returns the accusation by likening the worship of pagan idols to the worship of poles or stakes. In his book \"De Corona\", written in 204, Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross. While early Christians used the T-shape to represent the cross in writing and gesture, the use of the Greek cross\nDocument [3]: to be a mystical prefiguring of the cross of Christ\". Tertullian (c. 155 \u2013 c. 240), who used Roman numerals, not Greek, still remarks that the Greek letter \u03c4 and the Latin letter T have the same shape as the execution cross: \"Ipsa est enim littera Graecorum Tau, nostra autem T, species crucis\". Non-Christians too of the time when in the Roman Empire criminals were executed by crucifixion, considered identical the shape of the execution cross (\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 in Greek) and that of the letter tau. In the \"Trial of the Court of the Vowels\" of Lucian (125 \u2013 after 180),\nDocument [4]: through the gate, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set the mark \"Tau\" upon the foreheads of the men.' Now the Greek letter \"Tau\" and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which He predicted would be the sign on our foreheads.\" (\"omnes fideles [...] signatos illa nota scilicet de qua Ezechiel: Dicit dominus ad me, Pertransi in medio portae in media Hierusalem, et da signum Tau in frontibus virorum. Ipsa est enim littera Graecorum Tau, nostra autem T, species crucis, quam portendebat futuram in frontibus nostris\"). The universality of the Early Christian practice of tracing\nDocument [5]: that the Greek letter \u03c4 and the Latin letter T have the same shape as the execution cross: \"Ipsa est enim littera Graecorum Tau, nostra autem T, species crucis\". In the \"Trial of the Court of the Vowels\" of non-Christian Lucian (125 \u2013 after 180), the Greek letter Sigma (\u03a3) accuses the letter Tau (\u03a4) of having provided tyrants with the model for the wooden instrument with which to crucify people and demands that Tau be executed on his own shape: \"It was his body that tyrants took for a model, his shape that they imitated, when they set up\nDocument [6]: hieroglyph \"two crossed sticks\" (Gardiner Z9). According to W. E. Vine's \"Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words\", worshippers of Tammuz in Chaldea and thereabouts used the cross as symbol of that god. The shape of the cross (\"crux\", \"stauros\" \"stake, gibbet\"), as represented by the letter T, came to be used as a \"seal\" or symbol of Early Christianity by the 2nd century. Clement of Alexandria in the early 3rd century calls it (\"the Lord's sign\") he repeats the idea, current as early as the Epistle of Barnabas, that the number 318 (in Greek numerals, \u03a4\u0399\u0397) in Genesis 14:14 was\nDocument [7]: Christian writers who speak of the shape of the particular gibbet on which Jesus died invariably describe it as having a cross-beam. For instance, the Epistle of Barnabas, which was certainly earlier than 135, and may have been of the 1st century AD, the time when the gospel accounts of the death of Jesus were written, likened it to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the numeric value of 300), and to the position assumed by Moses in . Justin Martyr (100\u2013165) explicitly says the cross of Christ was of two-beam shape: \"That lamb which was commanded\nDocument [8]: to it.\" In language very similar to that of Minucius Felix, Tertullian, too, who distinguished between \"stipes\" (stake) and \"crux\" (cross), noted that it was the cross that people associated with Christianity. And he indicated that the shape of the cross is that of the letter T: \"The Greek letter Tau and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which (God) predicted would be the sign on our foreheads\", and compared it to the shape of a bird with outstretched wings.

In 1802, the production of graphite leads from graphite and clay was patented by the Koh-I-Noor company in Vienna. In England, pencils continued to be made from whole sawn graphite. Henry Bessemer's first successful invention (1838) was a method of compressing graphite powder into solid graphite thus allowing the waste from sawing to be reused. American colonists imported pencils from Europe until after the American Revolution. Benjamin Franklin advertised pencils for sale in his \"Pennsylvania Gazette\" in 1729, and George Washington used a three-inch pencil when he surveyed the Ohio Territory in\nDocument [3]: thereby pushing a new tip to the top. Invented by Harold Grossman for Empire Pencil Company in 1967 and subsequently improved upon by Arthur D. Little for Empire from 1969 through the early 1970s; the plastic pencil was commercialised by Empire as the \"EPCON\" Pencil. These pencils were co-extruded, extruding a plasticised graphite mix within a wood-composite core. Residual graphite from a pencil stick is not poisonous, and graphite is harmless if consumed. Although lead has not been used for writing since antiquity, lead poisoning from pencils was not uncommon. Until the middle of the 20th century the paint used\nDocument [4]: in this fashion in 2005. The ability to leave marks on paper and other objects gave graphite its name, given in 1789 by German mineralogist Abraham Gottlob Werner. It stems from \"graphein\", meaning \"to write\" or \"draw\" in Ancient Greek. From the 16th century, all pencils were made with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by Nicolas-Jacques Cont\u00e9 in 1795. It is chemically unrelated to the metal lead, whose ores had a similar appearance, hence the continuation of the name.

However, the distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s. The town of Keswick, near the original findings of block graphite, still manufactures pencils, the factory also being the location of the Cumberland Pencil Museum. The meaning of \"graphite writing implement\" apparently evolved late in the 16th century. Around 1560, an Italian couple named Simonio and Lyndiana Bernacotti made what are likely the first blueprints for the modern, wood-encased carpentry pencil.

At the time of Dixon's death in 1869, the Joseph Dixon Crucible Company was the largest manufacturer of graphite products in the world.

An allosteric site is a site on an enzyme, unrelated to its active site, which can bind an effector molecule. This interaction is another mechanism of enzyme regulation. Allosteric modification usually happens in proteins with more than one subunit.

These molecules then cause a change in the conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme.
