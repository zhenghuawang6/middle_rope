However, he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it, its evolution was perfectly feasible: ...if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye\nDocument [9](Title: Evolution of the eye) skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through. All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin's theory. The first fossils of eyes found to date are from the lower Cambrian period (about ). The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the \"Cambrian explosion\". One of the many hypotheses for \"causes\" of the Cambrian explosion is the \"Light Switch\" theory of Andrew Parker: It holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution. Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for\nDocument [10](Title: Evolution of the eye) less than 364,000 years. Whether the eye evolved once or many times depends on the definition of an eye. All eyed animals share much of the genetic machinery for eye development. This suggests that the ancestor of eyed animals had some form of light-sensitive machinery \u2013 even if it was not a dedicated optical organ. However, even photoreceptor cells may have evolved more than once from molecularly similar chemoreceptor cells. Probably, photoreceptor cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion. Higher-level similarities \u2013 such as the use of the protein crystallin in the independently derived cephalopod and vertebrate lenses \u2013 reflect\n\nQuestion: what is the first step in the evolution of the eye\nAnswer:", "model_answer": " The first step in the evolution of the eye is the development of photoreceptor proteins that can sense light. These proteins, called \"eyespots,\" can only detect ambient brightness and are not sufficient for vision. They are found in many unicellular organisms and some bacteria. The development of eyespots is considered the earliest stage in the evolution of the eye.", "model": "../download/vicuna-7b-v1.5-16k", "model_temperature": 0, "model_top_p": "None", "model_prompt_mention_random_ordering": false, "model_use_random_ordering": false}

In the shorts Jerry would often try to get Tom in trouble with Spike making him a shoo-in for a beating from the bulldog. Spike has a few weaknesses that Tom tries to capitalize upon: his possessiveness about his bone and his ticklishness. He made his first appearance in the 1942 Tom and Jerry cartoon Dog Trouble, and his first speaking role was in 1944's The Bodyguard, where he was voiced by Billy Bletcher up until 1949, from which point he was voiced by Daws Butler.

On 1 September 1965, OPEC moved to Vienna, Austria, after Switzerland declined to extend diplomatic privileges. During 1961\u20131975, the five founding nations were joined by Qatar (1961), Indonesia (1962\u20132008, rejoined 2014-2016), Libya (1962), United Arab Emirates (originally just the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971), Ecuador (1973\u20131992, rejoined 2007), and Gabon (1975\u20131994, rejoined 2016). By the early 1970s, OPEC's membership accounted for more than half of worldwide oil production.

Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016.

The song is famous for its \"la la la\" hook.\nDocument [5](Title: Can't Get You Out of My Head) \"didn't try to force any structure after the event. The seeds were watered and they very quickly sprouted into something bigger than any of us.\" Likewise, Davis commented: \"It breaks a few rules as it starts with a chorus and in comes the 'la's'\u2013 that is what confused my publisher [Fuller] when he first heard it.\" Through the lyrics of the song, its singer expresses an obsession with an anonymous figure. Dorian Lynskey from \"The Guardian\" termed the song a \"mystery\" as Minogue never reveals the identity of her object of infatuation.

After three and a half hours, the demo was recorded and the vocals were laid afterwards. Dennis called their recording setup for the song, \"the most primitive set-up you could imagine!

Dennis later remarked: \"Even though Kylie wasn't the first artist to be offered the song, I don't believe it was meant to go to anyone other than Kylie, and I don't believe anyone else would have done the incredible job she did with it, with the video, looking super-hot!\" \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" is a midtempo dance song, combining synth-pop and neo-disco, which has a tempo of 126 beats per minute.

Minogue chants a \"la la la\" hook in the song, which is often heralded as its most appealing part. BBC Radio 2 noted that the composition of the song is \"deceptively simple, but its veins run with the whole history of electronic music.\" They described the song's bassline as \"pulsing,\" and recognised influences of English rock band New Order and German electronic music band Kraftwerk.

The Persian physician, alchemist, polymath and philosopher Rhazes (854 CE \u2013 925 CE) is credited with the discovery of ethanol. The word \"alcohol\" is from the Arabic \"kohl\" (), a powder used as an eyeliner. Al- is the Arabic definite article, equivalent to \"the\" in English. \"Alcohol\" was originally used for the very fine powder produced by the sublimation of the natural mineral stibnite to form antimony trisulfide . It was considered to be the essence or \"spirit\" of this mineral. It was used as an antiseptic, eyeliner, and\nDocument [3](Title: Alcohol) cosmetic. The meaning of alcohol was extended to distilled substances in general, and then narrowed to ethanol, when \"spirits\" was a synonym for hard liquor. Bartholomew Traheron, in his 1543 translation of John of Vigo, introduces the word as a term used by \"barbarous\" (Moorish) authors for \"fine powder.\" Vigo wrote: \"the barbarous auctours use alcohol, or (as I fynde it sometymes wryten) alcofoll, for moost fine poudre.\" The 1657 \"Lexicon Chymicum\", by William Johnson glosses the word as \"antimonium sive stibium.\" By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including \"alcohol of wine,\" the\nDocument [4](Title: Drink) it to be the blood of those who had once battled against the gods\".

Spirits are distilled beverages that contain no added sugar and have at least 20% alcohol by volume (ABV). Popular spirits include borovi\u010dka, brandy, gin, rum, slivovitz, tequila, vodka, and whisky.

The production method was written in code, suggesting that it was being kept secret. In 1437, \"burned water\" (brandy) was mentioned in the records of the County of Katzenelnbogen in Germany. It was served in a tall, narrow glass called a \"Goderulffe\". Claims upon the origin of specific beverages are controversial, often invoking national pride, but they are plausible after the 12th century AD, when Irish whiskey and German brandy became available.

In China, archaeological evidence indicates that the true distillation of alcohol began during the 12th century Jin or Southern Song dynasties.

However, another century would pass before problems, especially bursting bottles, would be solved and champagne would become popular. The original grain spirit, whisky (or \"whiskey\" in Hiberno-English) and its specific origins are unknown but the distillation of whisky has been performed in Ireland and Scotland for centuries. The first confirmed written record of whisky comes from 1405 in\nDocument [8](Title: Ethanol) Geneva, Switzerland. The term \u201calcohol\u201d now refers to a wider class of substances in chemistry nomenclature, but in common parlance it remains the name of ethanol.

Beer was likely brewed from barley as early as the 6th century BCE (600\u2013500 BCE) in Egypt.

The waste products of digestion (feces) are defecated from the anus via the rectum. There are several organs and other components involved in the digestion of food. The organs known as the accessory digestive glands are the liver, gall bladder and pancreas. Other components include the mouth, salivary glands, tongue, teeth and epiglottis. The largest structure of the digestive system is the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). This starts at the mouth and ends at the anus, covering a distance of about nine (9) metres.

There are three major divisions: The large intestine also called the colon, consists of the cecum, rectum, and anal canal. It also includes the appendix, which is attached to the cecum. The colon is further divided into: The main function of the large intestine is to absorb water. The area of the large intestinal mucosa of an adult human is about 2 m. The gut is an endoderm-derived structure.

At this point some electrolytes like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of ingested food (e.g., a large part of ingested amylose, starch which has been shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). As the chyme moves through the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. The ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. The muscles of\nDocument [7](Title: Intestinal epithelium) surface of the enterocytes is the glycocalyx, which is a loose network composed of the oligosaccharide side chains of integral membrane hydrolases and other enzymes essential for the digestion of proteins and carbohydrates. These glycoproteins, glycolipids, and enzymes catalyze the final digestive stages of luminal carbohydrates and proteins. The monosaccharides and amino acids thus produced are subsequently transported across the intestinal epithelium and eventually into the bloodstream. The absorption of electrolytes and water is one of the most important functions of the digestive tract. Water absorption is passive and isotonic - depending on the speed and direction of solute flow.\nDocument [8](Title: Human digestive system) Human digestive system The human digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder). Digestion involves the breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components, until they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body. The process of digestion has many stages. The first stage is the cephalic phase of digestion which begins with gastric secretions in response to the sight and smell of food. The next stage starts in the mouth. Chewing, in which food is mixed with saliva, begins the mechanical process of digestion. This produces\nDocument [9](Title: Chiton) digested by enzymes from a pair of large pharyngeal glands. The oesophagus, in turn, opens into a stomach, where enzymes from a digestive gland complete the breakdown of the food. Nutrients are absorbed through the linings of the stomach and the first part of the intestine. The intestine is divided in two by a sphincter, with the latter part being highly coiled and functioning to compact the waste matter into faecal pellets. The anus opens just behind the foot. Chitons lack a clearly demarcated head; their nervous system resembles a dispersed ladder. No true ganglia are present, as in other\nDocument [10](Title: Malabsorption) Malabsorption Malabsorption is a state arising from abnormality in absorption of food nutrients across the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Impairment can be of single or multiple nutrients depending on the abnormality. This may lead to malnutrition and a variety of anaemias.

Clement's contemporary Tertullian rejects the accusation that Christians are \"crucis religiosi\" (i.e. \"adorers of the gibbet\"), and returns the accusation by likening the worship of pagan idols to the worship of poles or stakes. In his book \"De Corona\", written in 204, Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.

Non-Christians too of the time when in the Roman Empire criminals were executed by crucifixion, considered identical the shape of the execution cross (\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 in Greek) and that of the letter tau.

In the \"Trial of the Court of the Vowels\" of non-Christian Lucian (125 \u2013 after 180), the Greek letter Sigma (\u03a3) accuses the letter Tau (\u03a4) of having provided tyrants with the model for the wooden instrument with which to crucify people and demands that Tau be executed on his own shape: \"It was his body that tyrants took for a model, his shape that they imitated, when they set up\nDocument [6](Title: Cross) hieroglyph \"two crossed sticks\" (Gardiner Z9). According to W. E. Vine's \"Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words\", worshippers of Tammuz in Chaldea and thereabouts used the cross as symbol of that god. The shape of the cross (\"crux\", \"stauros\" \"stake, gibbet\"), as represented by the letter T, came to be used as a \"seal\" or symbol of Early Christianity by the 2nd century. Clement of Alexandria in the early 3rd century calls it (\"the Lord's sign\") he repeats the idea, current as early as the Epistle of Barnabas, that the number 318 (in Greek numerals, \u03a4\u0399\u0397) in Genesis 14:14 was\nDocument [7](Title: Crucifixion of Jesus) Christian writers who speak of the shape of the particular gibbet on which Jesus died invariably describe it as having a cross-beam. For instance, the Epistle of Barnabas, which was certainly earlier than 135, and may have been of the 1st century AD, the time when the gospel accounts of the death of Jesus were written, likened it to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the numeric value of 300), and to the position assumed by Moses in . Justin Martyr (100\u2013165) explicitly says the cross of Christ was of two-beam shape: \"That lamb which was commanded\nDocument [8](Title: Instrument of Jesus' crucifixion) to it.\" In language very similar to that of Minucius Felix, Tertullian, too, who distinguished between \"stipes\" (stake) and \"crux\" (cross), noted that it was the cross that people associated with Christianity. And he indicated that the shape of the cross is that of the letter T: \"The Greek letter Tau and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which (God) predicted would be the sign on our foreheads\", and compared it to the shape of a bird with outstretched wings.

And because the cross was to express the grace [of our redemption] by the letter \u03a4, he says also, 'Three Hundred'.

In 1802, the production of graphite leads from graphite and clay was patented by the Koh-I-Noor company in Vienna. In England, pencils continued to be made from whole sawn graphite. Henry Bessemer's first successful invention (1838) was a method of compressing graphite powder into solid graphite thus allowing the waste from sawing to be reused.

These pencils were co-extruded, extruding a plasticised graphite mix within a wood-composite core. Residual graphite from a pencil stick is not poisonous, and graphite is harmless if consumed.

From the 16th century, all pencils were made with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by Nicolas-Jacques Cont\u00e9 in 1795.

The meaning of \"graphite writing implement\" apparently evolved late in the 16th century.

But the American Civil War created a demand for a dry, clean, portable writing instrument and led to the mass production of pencils. At the time of Dixon's death in 1869, the Joseph Dixon Crucible Company was the largest manufacturer of graphite products in the world.

Carnot asked Cont\u00e9 to create a pencil that did not rely on foreign imports.

The horizon is horizontal. At many locations, the true horizon is obscured by trees, buildings, mountains, etc., and the resulting intersection of earth and sky is called the \"visible horizon\". When looking at a sea from a shore, the part of the sea closest to the horizon is called the offing. The word \"horizon\" derives from the Greek \"\u1f41\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\" \"horiz\u014dn kyklos\", \"separating circle\", from\n\nQuestion: if there is a line that lies parallel to the horizon it is said to be\nAnswer:", "model_answer": " The line that lies parallel to the horizon is called the \"line at infinity.\"", "model": "../download/vicuna-7b-v1.5-16k", "model_temperature": 0, "model_top_p": "None", "model_prompt_mention_random_ordering": false, "model_use_random_ordering": false}

In the alternating current system, transformers were used between the (relatively) high voltage distribution system and the customer loads. Lamps and small motors could still be operated at some convenient low voltage, but the transformers allowed power to be transmitted at much higher voltages, say, ten times that of the loads.

In some cases completely self protected transformers are used, which have a circuit breaker built in, so a fused cutout isn't needed. The low voltage secondary windings are attached to three or four terminals on the transformer's side. Higher secondary voltages, such as 480 volts, are sometimes required for commercial and industrial uses. Some industrial customers require three-phase power at secondary voltages.

This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as neon sign transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its secondary current by means of internal leakage inductance. A normal (low leakage inductance) high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current.

High voltage cannot readily be used for lighting or motors, so transmission-level voltages must be reduced for end-use equipment. Transformers are used to change the voltage levels in alternating current (AC) transmission circuits. Because transformers made voltage changes practical, and AC generators were more efficient than those using DC, AC became dominant after the introduction of practical systems of distribution in Europe in 1891 and the conclusion in 1892 of the War of Currents, a competition being fought on many fronts in the US between\nDocument [6](Title: Extra-low voltage) voltage systems, for example SELV, PELV, FELV.

Modern battery operated hand tools fall in the SELV category.

Audio transformers that operate with loudspeaker voltages and current are larger than those that operate at microphone or line level, which carry much less power.

Being magnetic devices, audio transformers are susceptible to external magnetic fields such as those generated by AC current-carrying conductors. \"Hum\" is a term commonly used to describe unwanted signals originating from the \"mains\" power supply (typically 50 or 60 Hz).

(\"Low\" voltage is relative; even 600 V can be instantly lethal when touched.) Since utilities supply high-voltage AC, DC railways use converter stations to produce relatively low-voltage DC (usually 3000 volts or less). Originally they used rotary converters, a few of which are even still in operation, but most were supplanted first by mercury arc rectifiers and then by semiconductor rectifiers.

In chronic angular cheilitis, there may be suppuration (pus formation), exfoliation (scaling) and formation of granulation tissue. Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\"collapse of jaws\").

Habits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Some consider habitual lip licking or picking to be a form of nervous tic, and do not consider this to be true angular cheilitis, instead calling it \"perl\u00e8che\" (derived from the French word \"pourl\u00e8cher\" meaning \"to lick one\u2019s lips\"), or\nDocument [9](Title: Oral candidiasis) of \"C. albicans\".

While postmortem glycogen levels are often depleted through the onset of rigor mortis, marine mammals have a much delayed onset of rigor mortis, even in warm conditions, presumably due to the high content of oxymyoglobin in the muscle that may permit aerobic metabolism to continue slowly for some time after the death of the animal. Additionally, in cold conditions, glycogen's depletion is halted at -18 \u00b0C (-0.4 \u00b0F) and lower temperatures in comminuted meat.

Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs 48 to 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death. At the time of death, a condition called \"primary flaccidity\" occurs. Following this, the muscles stiffen in rigor mortis. All muscles in the body are affected. Starting between two and six hours following death, rigor mortis begins with the eyelids, neck, and jaw. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle\nDocument [8](Title: Advanced meat recovery) Advanced meat recovery Advanced meat recovery (AMR) is a slaughterhouse deboning process by which the last traces of skeletal muscle meat are removed from animal bones after the primal cuts have been carved off manually. The machinery used in this process separates meat from bone by scraping, shaving, or pressing the meat from the bone without breaking or grinding the bone. Products produced by advanced meat recovery machinery can be labeled using terms associated with hand-deboned product (i.e., \"beef\", \"pork\", \"beef trimmings\", etc.). AMR meat typically is used as an ingredient in products requiring further processing, such as hot dogs.\nDocument [9](Title: Rigor Mortis (radio)) Rigor Mortis (radio) Rigor Mortis is a BBC Radio 4 black comedy set in the pathology department at an NHS hospital. It centres on the working lives of the pathologists and attendant staff who work in the department. Much of the humour of the show springs from the characters' varying views on death and their contrasting beliefs about the relative importance of their work.

Among those animals that have a heart, the \"fresh\" stage begins immediately after the heart stops beating. From the moment of death, the body begins cooling or warming to match the temperature of the ambient environment, during a stage called rigor mortis. Shortly after death, within three to six hours, the muscular tissues become rigid and incapable of relaxing, during a stage called rigor mortis. Since blood is no longer being pumped through the body, gravity causes it to drain to the dependent portions of the body, creating an overall bluish-purple discolouration termed livor mortis or, more commonly, lividity.\n\nQuestion: what are the importance of rigor mortis in meat processing\nAnswer:", "model_answer": " Rigor mortis is very important in meat technology. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determine the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length.

In Canada, novelist Yann Martel meets Pi Patel; Martel has been told that Pi's life story would be a good subject for a book. Pi tells his story to Yann: Pi's father names him Piscine Molitor Patel after the swimming pool in France. In secondary school in Pondicherry, he adopts the name \"Pi\" (the Greek letter, ) to avoid the sound-alike nickname \"Pissing Patel\". He is raised in a Hindu family, but at 12 years old, is introduced to Christianity and then Islam, and decides to follow all three religions as he \"just wants to love God\". His mother\nDocument [8](Title: Life of Pi (film)) the hyena. In this story, the cook kills the sailor and feeds on his flesh. He also kills Pi's mother after which Pi kills him with a knife and uses his remains as food and fish bait. The insurance agents are dissatisfied with this story, but they leave without questioning Pi further. Yann recognizes the parallels between the two stories, noting that in the second one, Pi fills the role of the tiger. Pi asks which story the writer prefers, and Yann chooses the first, to which Pi replies, \"and so it goes with God\".

A 2013 investigation by the Hollywood Reporter brought to light leaked emails suggesting that animals involved in the filming of \"Life of Pi\" had been mistreated during the filming despite the American Humane Association's \"No Animals Were Harmed\" certification on the film. In an April 7, 2011, ACA monitor, Gina Johnson, wrote that \"last week we almost killed King\".

The investigators note parallels between the two stories. They soon conclude that the hyena symbolizes the cook, the zebra the sailor, the orangutan Pi's mother, and the tiger represents Pi. Pi points out that neither story can be proven and neither explains the cause of the shipwreck, so he asks the officials which story they prefer: the one without animals or the one with animals. They eventually choose the story with the animals.

By 1933, some experts were predicting that the \"thirty-hour workweek was within a month of becoming federal law.\" Congress began hearings on mandating the 30-hour workweek, and the Senate even passed the bill (which was written by Hugo Black and sponsored in the House by William Connery) fifty-three to thirty. Newly elected President, Franklin Roosevelt initially supported the bill,\nDocument [8](Title: Workweek and weekend) Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday. Historically, the Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the \"weekend\" first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of the nineteenth century. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929. Some\nDocument [9](Title: Soviet calendar) implemented for most workers, with a common day of rest for all workers interrupting their work weeks. Five six-day work weeks were assigned to each Gregorian month, more or less, with the five national holidays converting normal work days into days of rest. On both five- and six-day work weeks were abandoned in favor of seven-day work weeks. Work weeks were never collected into 30-day months. The Gregorian calendar was implemented in Russia on by dropping the Julian dates of pursuant to a Sovnarkom decree signed (Julian) by Vladimir Lenin. The decree required that the Julian date was to be\nDocument [10](Title: Soviet calendar) . Each day of the five-day week was labeled by either one of five colors or a Roman numeral from I to V. Each worker was assigned a color or number to identify his or her day of rest. Eighty per cent of each factory's workforce was at work every day (except holidays) in an attempt to increase production while 20% were resting. But if a husband and wife, and their relatives and friends, were assigned different colors or numbers, they would not have a common rest day for their family and social life. Furthermore, machines broke down more frequently\n\nQuestion: when did the 5 day work week begin\nAnswer:", "model_answer": " The five-day workweek began in the United States in 1908 when a New England cotton mill instituted a five-day workweek so that Jewish workers would not have to work on the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.

Like other jellyfish, lion's manes are capable of both sexual reproduction in the medusa stage and asexual reproduction in the polyp stage. Lion's mane jellyfish have four different stages in their year-long lifespan: a larval stage, a polyp stage, an ephyrae stage, and the medusa stage. The female jellyfish carries its fertilized eggs in its tentacle, where the eggs grow into larva. When the larva are old enough, the female deposits them on a hard surface, where the larva soon grow into polyps. The polyps begin to reproduce asexually, creating stacks of small creatures called ephyrae. The individual ephyrae\nDocument [6](Title: Lion's mane jellyfish) showy, trailing tentacles reminiscent of a lion's mane. They can vary greatly in size: although capable of attaining a bell diameter of over , those found in lower latitudes are much smaller than their far northern counterparts, with a bell about in diameter. Size seems to dictate coloration: larger specimens are a vivid crimson to dark purple while smaller specimens grade to a lighter orange or tan, occasionally colorless. The bell of the lion's mane jellyfish is scalloped into eight lobes (lappets), each lobe containing from 70 to 150 tentacles, arranged in four fairly distinct rows. Along the bell margin\nDocument [7](Title: Lion's mane jellyfish) remains of a lion's mane jellyfish that had broken up into countless pieces in Wallis Sands State Beach, Rye, New Hampshire, in the United States. Considering the size of the species, it is possible that this mass incident was caused by a single specimen. The lion's mane jellyfish appears in the Sherlock Holmes short story \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\" published in \"The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes\". Holmes discovers at the end of the story that the true killer of a professor who died shortly after going swimming (shouting \"the lion's mane\" before he succumbed) was actually this jellyfish.\nDocument [8](Title: Lion's mane jellyfish) blue whale \u2013 has earned it the status of one of the longest known animals in the world. As coldwater species, these jellyfish cannot cope with warmer waters. The jellyfish are pelagic for most of their lives but tend to settle in shallow, sheltered bays towards the end of their one-year lifespan. In the open ocean, lion's mane jellyfish act as floating oases for certain species, such as shrimp, medusafish, butterfish, harvestfish, and juvenile prowfish, providing both a reliable source of food and protection from predators .

Jellyfish have a complex life cycle which includes both sexual and asexual phases, with the medusa being the sexual stage in most instances.

As a result of these operations, the remaining Romanian territories remained unoccupied, tying down nearly 1,000,000 Central Powers troops and prompting \"The Times\" to describe the Romanian front as \"The only point of light in the East\".

Additionally, the German Chief of the General Staff, General Erich Von Falkenhayn was forced to resign from office though his successor appointed him to command the combined Central Powers forces against Romania, along with General August von Mackensen. Kaiser Wilhelm II immediately replaced Falkenhayn with Paul von Hindenburg.

The Central Powers were thereby denied a quick victory and forced to fight a war on two fronts. The German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and had permanently incapacitated 230,000 more French and British troops than it had lost itself. Despite this, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of obtaining an early victory. 1916 was characterized by two great battles on the Western front, at Verdun and the Somme.

The Central Powers win by managing to knock out France and the British Expeditionary Force in the west towards the beginning of the war. Then they defeat Russia before the United States can intervene. A few years later, the German Empire intervenes in the Russian Revolution and defeats the Bolsheviks, but the Russian Empire is mostly divided and therefore no longer a great power.

The strikes were seen to be instigated by treasonous elements, with the Jews taking most of the blame. The weakness of Germany's strategic position was exacerbated by the rapid collapse of the other Central Powers in late 1918, following Allied victories on the\nDocument [10](Title: Macedonian Front) to a Bulgarian invasion in Macedonia. The Allies for their part took advantage of that, reinforcing and consolidating their positions behind the borders. Thus there resulted a clear, albeit incomplete victory for the Central Powers.
