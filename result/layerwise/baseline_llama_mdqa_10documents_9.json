After its first inception as \"Gablinger's Diet Beer,\" developed in 1967 by Joseph L. Owades, PhD, a biochemist working for New York's Rheingold Brewery, the recipe was given by Owades to Chicago's Peter Hand Brewing. That year, Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors, renamed Meister Brau Brewing, and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite, a companion to their flagship Meister Brau. Under the new management, Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems, and in 1972, sold several of its existing labels to Miller. The recipe was relaunched simply as \"Lite\" on packaging and in advertising (with \"Lite Beer from Miller\" being its \"official\" name until the late '90s) in the test markets of Springfield, Illinois, Knoxville, Tennessee, and San Diego, California, in 1973, and heavily marketed using masculine pro sports players and other, so-called, macho figures of the day in an effort to sell to the key beer-drinking male demographic. Miller Lite was introduced nationally in 1975. Miller's heavy-advertising approach worked where the two previous light beers had failed, and Miller's early production totals of 12.8 million barrels quickly increased to 24.2 million barrels by 1977 as Miller rose to 2nd place in the American brewing marketplace. Other brewers responded, in particular Anheuser-Busch with its heavily advertised Bud Light in 1982, which eventually overtook Lite in sales by 1994. Anheuser-Busch played on the branding style of \"Lite\" by highlighting the fact that their beer was called \"Bud Light,\" as \"everything else is just a light.\" In 1992, light beers became the biggest domestic beer in America, and in 1998, Miller relabeled its \"Lite\" brand as \"Miller Lite.\"\n\nQuestion: what was the first light beer in the us\nAnswer: [/INST]", "model_answer": "  According to the search results, the first light beer in the US was Miller Lite, which was introduced in 1973 after its development by Joseph L.

Back in the forest, Titania, Queen of Fairies (Florence Turner), quarrels with Penelope, who avenges herself by sending Puck (Gladys Hulette) away with a magic herb, which, dabbed on the eyes of a sleeping person, shall make the \"victim\" fall in love with the first person to appear after awakening.

Similarly, this failure to identify and to distinguish is what leads Puck to mistake one set of lovers for another in the forest, placing the flower's juice on Lysander's eyes instead of Demetrius'.

In original performance \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", the actor for Egeus and Philostrate were probably one and the same. This can be gathered through discrepancies between the First Folio and earlier quarto versions of the play. In Act V, scene 1, for example, the quartos say \"Call Philostrate\", while the 1623 Folio says \"Call Egeus\". One actor filling both roles also explains some of the jumbled dialogue in this scene, as it was probably the result of confusion over the role the actor was playing at\nDocument [5](Title: A Midsummer Night's Dream) can have no singular answer or meaning. In 1969, Michael Taylor argued that previous critics offered a too cheerful view of what the play depicts. He emphasised the less pleasant aspects of the otherwise appealing fairies and the nastiness of the mortal Demetrius prior to his enchantment. He argued that the overall themes are the often painful aspects of love and the pettiness of people, which here include the fairies. In 1970, R.A. Zimbardo viewed the play as full of symbols. The Moon and its phases alluded to in the play, in his view, stand for permanence in mutability. The\nDocument [6](Title: A Midsummer Night's Dream) first bliss of new and reunited lovers.

Both David Wiles of the University of London and Harold Bloom of Yale University have strongly endorsed the reading of this play under the themes of Carnivalesque, Bacchanalia, and Saturnalia.

Oberon and Titania are estranged because she refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his knight, since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers.

Meanwhile, researchers also realized that early investigations, relying heavily on psychological models, were narrowly focused on only short-term and immediate effects. The \"stimuli-reaction\" model introduced the possibility of profound long-term media effects. The shift from short-term to long-term effect studies marked the renewal of media effects research.

The use of mass media during World War II, created a surge of academic interest in mass media messaging and resulted in the creation of a new field, communication science (Lazarsfeld & Merton, 2000). The field of media psychology gained prominence n the 1950s when television was becoming popular in American households. Psychologists responded to widespread social concerns about the children and their television viewing. For example, researchers began to study the impact of television viewing on children's reading skills.\nDocument [5](Title: History of media studies) question of media \"effects\" on politics was left largely unaddressed until the late 1960s. Eventually Mass Communication scholars began to study political behavior again and the limited-effects model was called into question. As a response to the previous emphasis upon media effects, from the 1970s researchers became interested in how audiences make sense of media texts. The \"uses and gratifications\" model, associated with Jay Blumler and Elihu Katz, reflected this growing interest in the 'active audience'. One such example of this type of research was conducted by Hodge and Tripp, and separately Palmer, about how school-children make sense of the\nDocument [6](Title: History of media studies) ideas, methods and findings of Paul F. Lazarsfeld and his school: media effect studies. Their studies focused on measurable, short-term behavioral \u2018effects\u2019 of media and concluded that the media played a limited role in influencing public opinion. The \"Limited-Effects\" Model developed by Lazarsfeld and his colleagues from Columbia was highly influential in the development of media studies. The model claims the mass media has \"limited-effects\" on voting patterns. Voters are influenced, rather, through the \u2018two-step flow\u2019 model, the idea that media messages are disseminated through personal interaction with \u2018opinion leaders\u2019. The model of limited- effects was so influential that the\nDocument [7](Title: Media studies) criticism more broadly. The key date, according to Andrew Crisell, is 1959: When Joseph Trenaman left the BBC's Further Education Unit to become the first holder of the Granada Research Fellowship in Television at Leeds University. Soon after in 1966, the Centre for Mass Communication Research was founded at Leicester University, and degree programmes in media studies began to sprout at polytechnics and other universities during the 1970s and 1980s.

These representations may take spoken, written, pictorial or musical form.\" These definitions of propaganda clearly show that this was a school of thought that focused on media effects, as it highlighted the influence that media could have over its audiences attitudes and actions. Epitomizing this early school of media effects studies are experiments done by The Experimental Section of the Research Branch of the U.S. War Department's Information and Education Division. In the experiments, the effects of various U.S. wartime propaganda films on soldiers were observed. Current Propaganda studies are applied into many fields besides politics.

When a force deforms a material it generates elastic stresses and internal frictional stresses. Most often, frictional stress is described as being analogous to the stress that results from the\nDocument [9](Title: Bouc\u2013Wen model of hysteresis) large values that transition is abrupt. Parameters formula_14, formula_19 and formula_16 control the size and shape of the hysteretic loop. It has been found that the parameters of the Bouc\u2013Wen model are functionally redundant. Removing this redundancy is best achieved by setting formula_30. Wen assumed integer values for formula_17; however, all real positive values of formula_17 are admissible. The parameter formula_19 is positive by assumption, while the admissible values for formula_16, that is formula_35, can be derived from a thermodynamical analysis (Baber and Wen (1981)).

The dynamics of domain walls in ferromagnets is similar to that of grain boundaries and plasticity in metallurgy since both domain walls and grain boundaries are planar defects. As with any hysteretic process, the area inside the magnetization curve during one cycle represents the work that is performed on the material by the external field in reversing the magnetization, and is dissipated as heat. Common dissipative processes in magnetic materials include magnetostriction and domain wall motion. The coercivity is a measure of the degree of magnetic hysteresis and\nDocument [1](Title: Hysteresis) Magnetically soft (low coercivity) iron is used for the cores in electromagnets. The low coercivity reduces that energy loss associated with hysteresis.

He then routed the Aztec garrison at the town of Tizapancingo and returned the state to the native Totonacs under their leader Tlacochcalcatl of Cempoala. To restore the province to Aztec control, Moctezuma despatched Qualpopoca with instructions to defeat the Totonacs and their Spanish allies.

They met in a garden which most Aztec lords had as a refuge and to demonstrate culture. In the center of the garden was a large palace made of sandstone and fine woods such as cedar.

After the siege and complete destruction of the Aztec capital, he was captured on 13 August 1521, and marked the start of Spanish hegemony in central Mexico.

Multimers made up of identical subunits are referred to with a prefix of \"homo-\" (e.g. a homotetramer) and those made up of different subunits are referred to with a prefix of \"hetero-\", for example, a heterotetramer, such as the two alpha and two beta chains of hemoglobin. Proteins are frequently described as consisting of several structural units. These units include domains, motifs, and folds. Despite the fact that there are about 100,000 different proteins expressed in eukaryotic systems, there are many fewer different domains, structural motifs and folds. A structural domain is an element of\nDocument [8](Title: Structural Classification of Proteins database) a number of distinct folds.

For example, the \"All-\u03b1 proteins\" class contains >280 distinct folds, including: Globin-like (core: 6 helices; folded leaf, partly opened), long alpha-hairpin (2 helices; antiparallel hairpin, left-handed twist) and Type I dockerin domains (tandem repeat of two calcium-binding loop-helix motifs, distinct from the EF-hand).

The proposal was a fusion of the\nDocument [4](Title: Flag of Myanmar) The new flag is a horizontal tricolour flag of yellow, green and red charged with a five-pointed white star in the middle of the field. The yellow represents solidarity; the green symbolizes peace, tranquility and lush greenery; the red represents courage and determination; and the white star stands for the significance of the union of the country. Green, yellow, and red are also considered the Pan-African colours, leading commentators to note that the new flag looked distinctly \"African\" and even that it was being confused for the flag of an African country.

In 1438 the flag of Maastricht is described as being as a five-pointed star on a red field, with the first historic image dating from 1545. The mentioned image was published in the \"Wappenbuch von Meister IK\"-book in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. However, in 1549, the flag is stated as being \"yellow-white-red\". In 1647, the white-star-on-red design had apparently returned when the Peace of M\u00fcnster treaty was signed. The next known design is the white-red (with the upper part of the flag being white, and the lower part being red) design similar to the\nDocument [6](Title: Anthony Roll) of King Henry VIII, being richer in visual detail than all other sources put together.\" Among the most striking flags in the illustrations are the elongated ceremonial streamers, shown flying from all ships in varying numbers. These feature a Saint George red cross on white ground on the hoist, nearest the flagpole, and a very long tail striped in green and white. They all feature gold paint on the red and green, and silver paint (now oxidized to black) on the white. This artistic device was used either to simulate the fluttering of the flags or to actually display the\nDocument [7](Title: Flag of Belarus) World War. The white-red-white flag is used in protests against the government and by the Belarusian diaspora. The basic design of the national flag of Belarus was first described in Presidential Decree No.214 of June 7, 1995. The flag is a rectangular cloth consisting of two horizontal stripes: a red upper stripe covering two-thirds of the flag's height, and green lower stripe covering one-third. A vertical red-on-white Belarusian decorative pattern, which occupies one-ninth of the flag's length, is placed against the flagstaff. The flag's ratio of width to length is 1:2. The flag does not differ significantly from the flag\nDocument [8](Title: Newfoundland and Labrador) province. The two red triangles represent Labrador (the mainland portion of the province) and the island. In Pratt's words, the golden arrow points towards a \"brighter future\". The \"Pink, White and Green\" is a flag of 19th-century origins that enjoyed popularity in portions of the island in the late 19th century. It was flown on some vessels into the 20th century. It was never adopted by the Newfoundland government. A 1976 article reported that the tricolour flag was created in 1843 by then Roman Catholic Bishop of Newfoundland, Michael Anthony Fleming. The colours were intended to represent the symbolic union\nDocument [9](Title: Act on National Flag and Anthem) set down in the Prime Minister's Proclamation No. 57 of 1870, which stipulated that the flag have a seven-to-ten (7:10) ratio, with the red disc off-center by one-hundredth of the flag's length toward the side of the hoist. The background of the flag is white, and the disc red, but the exact color shades were not defined in the 1999 law. Further explanations from the government merely stated that the red color is a deep shade. Specifications published by the Ministry of Defense in 2008 defined the shades of red for the flag.

One reason given was the difficulty for rendering the map correctly on both sides of the flag. The civil ensign and naval ensign place it in the canton of a red or white field, respectively.

For monatomic gases, the speed of sound is about 75% of the mean speed that the atoms move in that gas. For a given ideal gas the molecular composition is fixed, and thus the speed of sound depends only on its temperature. At a constant temperature, the gas pressure has no effect on the speed of sound, since the density will increase, and since pressure and density (also proportional to pressure) have equal but opposite effects on the speed of sound, and the two contributions cancel out\nDocument [3](Title: Speed of sound) fluid dynamics, the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium.

As the sound-generating point begins to accelerate, the sound waves \"bunch up\" in the direction of motion and \"stretch out\" in the opposite direction. When the point reaches sonic speed (M = 1), it travels at the same speed as the sound waves it creates. Therefore, an infinite number of these sound waves \"pile up\" ahead of the point, forming a Shock wave.

For example, Koch was well aware that in the case of cholera, the causal agent, \"Vibrio cholerae\", could be found in both sick and healthy people, invalidating his first postulate.

Attempts to rigidly apply Koch's postulates to the diagnosis of viral diseases in the late 19th century, at a time when viruses could not be seen or isolated in culture, may have impeded the early development of the field of virology.

Koch is best known for his contributions to the germ theory of disease, proving that specific diseases were caused by specific pathogenic micro-organisms. He developed a series of criteria that have become known as the Koch's postulates. Koch was one of the first scientists to focus on the isolation of bacteria in pure culture resulting in his\nDocument [6](Title: Germ theory of disease) end caring for the sick. Searching for a cure, Kircher observed microorganisms under the microscope and invented the germ theory of disease, which he outlined in his \"Scrutinium pestis physico-medicum\" (Rome 1658). Building on Leeuwenhoek's work, physician Nicolas Andry argued in 1700 that microorganisms he called \"worms\" were responsible for smallpox and other diseases. In 1720, Richard Bradley theorised that the plague and 'all pestilential distempers' were caused by 'poisonous insects', living creatures viewable only with the help of microscopes. In 1762, the Austrian physician Marcus Antonius von Plenciz (1705-1786) published a book titled \"Opera medico-physica\". It outlined a theory\nDocument [7](Title: Microorganism) disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today. The discovery of microorganisms such as \"Euglena\" that did not fit into either the animal or plant kingdoms, since they were photosynthetic like plants, but motile like animals, led to the naming of a third kingdom in the 1860s. In 1860 John Hogg called this the Protoctista, and in 1866 Ernst Haeckel named it the Protista.

There are numerous species of these parasites, which are broadly classified into tapeworms, flukes, and roundworms. They often live in the gastrointestinal tract of their hosts, but they may also burrow into other organs, where they induce physiological damage. Soil-transmitted helminthiasis and schistosomiasis are the most important helminthiases, and are among the neglected tropical diseases. This group of helmianthiases have been targeted under the joint action of the world's\nDocument [8](Title: Parasitic worm) worms. Some other parasitic worm species from the annelids (ringed worms), including the leeches are ectoparasites and so are not classified as helminths which are endoparasites. Parasitic worms live in and feed in living hosts. They receive nourishment and protection while disrupting their hosts' nutrient absorption. This can cause weakness and disease of the host. In their adult form, parasitic worms cannot multiply in humans. Helminths are able to survive in their mammalian hosts for many years due to their ability to manipulate the immune response by secreting immunomodulatory products. All parasitic worms produce eggs for reproduction. These eggs have\nDocument [9](Title: Helminthiasis) memory and fluency. Large parasite burdens, particularly severe hookworm infections, are also associated with absenteeism, under-enrollment, and attrition in school children. Of all the known helminth species, the most important helminths with respect to understanding their transmission pathways, their control, inactivation and enumeration in samples of human excreta from dried feces, faecal sludge, wastewater, and sewage sludge are: Helminthiases are classified as follows (the disease names end with \"-sis\" and the causative worms are in brackets): Helminths are transmitted to the final host in several ways.

Helminths excrete into the intestine toxic substances after they feed. These substances then enter the circulatory and lymphatic systems of the host body. Chronic immune responses to helminthiasis may lead to increased susceptibility to other infections such as tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria. There is conflicting information about whether deworming reduces HIV progression and viral load and increases CD4 counts in antiretroviral naive and experienced individuals, although the most recent Cochrane review found some evidence that this approach might have favorable effects.

Although the daily consumption of an individual worm (0.02\u20130.07 ml and 0.14\u20130.26 ml respectively) is small, the collective consumption under heavy infection can be clinically significantly.

Maintenance of NGN standards are now\nDocument [8](Title: SIP extensions for the IP Multimedia Subsystem) functionality. These extensions are based on Request for Comments (RFC) protocol recommendations by the IETF. The 3GPP, which is a collaboration between groups of telecommunications associations aimed at developing and maintaining the IMS, stated a series of requirements for SIP to be successfully used in the IMS. Some of them could be addressed by using existing capabilities and extensions in SIP while, in other cases, the 3GPP had to collaborate with the IETF to standardize new SIP extensions to meet the new requirements. In any case, the IETF evolves SIP in a generic basis, so that the use of its\nDocument [9](Title: SIP extensions for the IP Multimedia Subsystem) configured to relay messages across both networks according to these recommendations, user agents will need to implement extensions so that they can directly exchange media streams. These extensions are related to the Session Description Protocol offer/answer initial exchange, that will be used to gather the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of both ends so that they can establish a direct communication. Apart from all the explained extensions to SIP that make it possible for the IMS to work successfully, it is also necessary that the IMS framework interworks and exchanges services with existing network infrastructures, mainly the Public switched telephone network\nDocument [10](Title: SIP extensions for the IP Multimedia Subsystem) a format used to describe streaming media initialization parameters, carried in the body of SIP messages. The new SDP attributes are meant to describe the \"current status\" of the resource reservation, the \"desired status\" of the reservation to proceed with session establishment, and the \"confirmation status\", to indicate when the reservation status should be confirmed. In the IMS, the initial session parameter negotiation can be done by using the provisional responses and session description updating extensions, along with SDP in the body of the messages. The first offer, described by means of SDP, can be carried by the INVITE request\nDocument [1](Title: IP Multimedia Subsystem) To ease the integration with the Internet, IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible, e.g., SIP (Session Initiation Protocol).  According to the 3GPP, IMS is not intended to standardize applications, but rather to aid the access of multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals, i.e., to create a form of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). This is done by having a horizontal control layer that isolates the access network from the service layer.

The work was withdrawn for revisions after its third performance. In a Milanese newspaper, Giulio Ricordi published a defense of Puccini's skill as a composer, while criticizing Fontana's libretto. A revised version met with success at the Teatro del Giglio in Puccini's native Lucca on 5 September 1891. In 1892, further revisions reduced the length of the opera from four acts to three, in a version that was well received in Ferrara and was performed in Turin and in\nDocument [4](Title: Giacomo Puccini) referred to her well publicised affair with Arturo Toscanini. This version was in two acts; after its disastrous premiere, Puccini withdrew the opera, revising it for what was virtually a second premiere at Brescia in May 1904 and performances in Buenos Aires, London, the USA and Paris. In 1907, Puccini made his final revisions to the opera in a fifth version, which has become known as the \"standard version\". Today, the standard version of the opera is the version most often performed around the world. However, the original 1904 version is occasionally performed as well, and has been recorded.

In 1907, Puccini made several changes in the orchestral and vocal scores, and this became the fourth version, which was performed in Paris.

Many Roman dignitaries attended, as did Queen Margherita, though she arrived late, after the first act. The Prime Minister of Italy, Luigi Pelloux was present, with several members of his cabinet. A number of Puccini's operatic rivals were there, including Franchetti, Pietro Mascagni, Francesco Cilea and Ildebrando Pizzetti.

No type specimens are known; the specimen described by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743) is no longer extant. Subsequent generic names used for the crown-of-thorns starfish included \"Stellonia\", \"Echinaster\" and \"Echinites\", before settling on \"Acanthaster\" (Gervais 1841). Species names included \"echintes\", \"solaris\", \"mauritensis\", \"ellisii\", and \"ellisii pseudoplanci\" (with subspecies).

Its prehensile ability arises from the two rows of numerous tube feet that extend to the tip of each arm.

The starfish were observed to spawn (photograph) from December to January (early to mid-summer) in this region with most observations being in January.

Researchers note that the health of those living in rural areas is quantitatively and qualitatively different to those living in major metropolitan areas. These differences include often significant gaps in service delivery, accessibility and lower health outcomes. Rural areas and those who live in them are often understood as living in a spatially, economically, socially and culturally distinct group, although there are criticisms of this perspective. Despite the questions about the\nDocument [7](Title: Rural health care in Australia) framing of rural and remote areas and health services as 'other' to the metropolitan norm or majority, the framing does \"highlight a serious social and equity issue,\" particularly the gap in access and health outcomes for rural and remote populations.

However, the reaction is autocatalytic: 1 catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of formaldehyde to produce an additional molecule of 1. Hence, even a trace (as low as 3 ppm) of glycolaldehyde is enough to initiate the reaction. The autocatalytic cycle begins with the aldol reaction of 1 with formaldehyde to make glyceraldehyde (2).
