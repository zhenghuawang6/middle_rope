There was comparatively little nostalgia for the prewar era and the overall emphasis was on having everything new and more advanced than before.

Despite a rekindled national debate in 2008 on the established drinking age (initiated by several university presidents), a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found in September 2008 that 76% of New Jerseyans supported leaving the legal drinking age at 21 years. No significant differences emerged when considering gender, political affiliation, or region. However, parents of younger children were more likely to support keeping the age at 21 (83%) than parents of college-age students (67%).

Between 1970 and 1975, 29 states lowered the MLDA from 21 to 18, 19, or 20. This was primarily due to the passing of the 26th Amendment, which lowered the required voting age from 21 to 18. During the 1960s, both Congress and the state legislatures came under increasing pressure to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This was in large part due to the Vietnam War, in which many young men who were ineligible to vote (or legally drink) were conscripted to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the\nDocument [8](Title: Society of the United States) \"dry\", and to this day, a handful still do. During the Vietnam War era, attitudes swung well away from prohibition. Commentators noted that an eighteen-year-old could be drafted into the military to fight in a war overseas, but could not buy a beer. Most states lowered the legal drinking age to eighteen. Since 1980, the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use. The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. New York was the first state to enact tough drink-driving laws in 1980; since\nDocument [9](Title: National Minimum Drinking Age Act) the act did not violate the 21st amendment which reserved the right to regulate alcohol for all responsibilities not specifically appointed to the federal government to the states. However, as the act controlled the distribution of anywhere from $8 million to $99 million, depending on the size of the state, the act gave a strong incentive for states to change the drinking age to 21. By 1995, all 50 states, two permanently inhabited territories, and D.C. were in compliance, but Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (and Guam until 2010) remained at 18 despite them losing 10% of federal highway\nDocument [10](Title: Mothers Against Drunk Driving) federal penalty (a 5%\u2014later raised to 10%\u2014loss of federal highway dollars), for states that didn't raise the minimum legal age for the purchase and possession of alcohol to 21. After the United States Supreme Court upheld the law in the 1987 case of \"South Dakota v. Dole\", every state and the District of Columbia made the necessary adjustments by 1988 (but not the territories of Puerto Rico and Guam). However, in July 2010 Guam raised its drinking age to 21. In 1985, Lightner objected to the shifting focus of MADD, and left her position with the organization.

In 1984, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below).

The Ukrainian art of decorating eggs for Easter, known as \"pysanky\", dates to ancient, pre-Christian times. Similar variants of this form of artwork are seen amongst other eastern and central European cultures. The idea of an egg-giving hare went to the U.S. in the 18th century. Protestant German immigrants in the Pennsylvania Dutch area told their children about the \"Osterhase\" (sometimes spelled \"Oschter Haws\"). \"Hase\" means \"hare\", not rabbit, and in Northwest European folklore the \"Easter Bunny\" indeed is a hare.

Proteins are made of a chain of dehydrated amino acids. When enzymes cut proteins into pieces they add water back to the site at which they cut, called enzymatic hydrolysis, for proteins it is called proteolysis. The initial products of this hydrolysis are polypeptides, and smaller products are called simply peptides; these are called \"wheat protein hydrolysates\". These hydrolysates can create allergens out of wheat proteins that previously did not exist by the exposure of buried antigenic sites in the proteins.

In proteins a cysteine residue can form a disulfide bond with another cysteine residue, thus crosslinking the protein. Two crosslinked cysteines form a cystine molecule. Cysteine and methionine are generally produced by direct sulfurylation, but in some species they can be produced by transsulfuration, where the activated homoserine or serine is fused to a cysteine or homocysteine forming cystathionine. A similar compound is lanthionine, which can be seen as two alanine molecules joined via a thioether bond and is found in various organisms.

Insoluble dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible by humans, because humans do not have the required enzymes to break it down, and the human digestive system does not harbor enough of the types of microbes that can do so. Soluble dietary fiber comprises a variety of oligosaccharides, waxes, esters, resistant starches, and other carbohydrates that dissolve or gelatinize in water. Many of these soluble fibers can be fermented or partially fermented by microbes in the human digestive system to produce short-chain fatty acids which are absorbed and\nDocument [5](Title: Carbohydrate) fiber. Although it is not digestible, insoluble dietary fiber helps to maintain a healthy digestive system by easing defecation. Other polysaccharides contained in dietary fiber include resistant starch and inulin, which feed some bacteria in the microbiota of the large intestine, and are metabolized by these bacteria to yield short-chain fatty acids. In scientific literature, the term \"carbohydrate\" has many synonyms, like \"sugar\" (in the broad sense), \"saccharide\", \"ose\", \"glucide\", \"hydrate of carbon\" or \"polyhydroxy compounds with aldehyde or ketone\".

In the upper gastrointestinal tract, these compounds consist of bile acids and di- and monoacyl glycerols which solubilize triacylglycerols and cholesterol. Two mechanisms bring nutrients into contact with the epithelium: The multiple physical phases in the intestinal tract slow the rate of absorption compared to that of the suspension solvent alone.

Fructose, or fruit sugar, is found in many plants and in humans, it is metabolized in the liver, absorbed directly into the intestines during digestion, and found in semen. Trehalose, a major sugar of insects, is rapidly hydrolyzed into two glucose molecules to support continuous flight. Two joined monosaccharides are called a disaccharide and these are the simplest polysaccharides. Examples include sucrose and lactose. They are composed of two monosaccharide units bound together by a covalent bond known as a glycosidic linkage formed via a dehydration reaction, resulting in the loss of a hydrogen atom from one monosaccharide\nDocument [8](Title: Natural fiber) Implanting something made from naturally synthesized proteins, such as a keratin based implant, has the potential to be recognized as natural tissue by the body.

A 2012 study found that when answering yes or no questions, ouija use was significantly more accurate than guesswork, suggesting that it might draw on the unconscious mind.\nDocument [1](Title: Ouija) Following its commercial introduction by businessman Elijah Bond on July 1, 1890, the ouija board was regarded as a parlor game unrelated to the occult until American spiritualist Pearl Curran popularized its use as a divining tool during World War I. Spiritualists believed that the dead were able to contact the living and reportedly used a talking board very similar to a modern ouija board at their camps in Ohio in 1886 to ostensibly enable faster communication with spirits.\n\nQuestion: when did the ouija board first come out\nAnswer:", "model_answer": " The Ouija board was first commercially introduced by businessman Elijah Bond on July 1, 1890.", "model": "../download/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "model_temperature": 0, "model_top_p": "None", "model_prompt_mention_random_ordering": false, "model_use_random_ordering": false, "best_subspan_em": 1.0}

(born on March 5, 1512 in Rupelmonde, Flanders [now in Belgium]; died on December 2, 1594 in Duisburg, Duchy of Cleve [now in Germany]) was a cartographer famous for creating a heart-shaped representation of the earth (also called the \"Mercator projection\" of the earth) in response to a\nDocument [7](Title: Earth's orbit) presented his geocentric model in the 2nd century.

One notable work, often cited by others in mathematics, is \"Rough draft for an essay on the results of taking plane sections of a cone\" (1639).

Eventually, perfectly concentric spheres were abandoned as it was impossible to develop a sufficiently accurate model under that ideal. However, while providing for similar explanations, the later deferent and epicycle model was flexible enough to accommodate observations for many centuries. Although the basic tenets of Greek geocentrism were established by the time of Aristotle, the details of his system did not become standard.

In \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\", published in Nuremberg in 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus challenged the Western teaching of a geocentric universe in which the Sun revolved daily around the Earth. He observed that some Greek philosophers had proposed a heliocentric universe. This simplified the apparent epicyclic motions of the planets, making it feasible to represent the planets' paths as simple circles. This could be modelled by the use of gears. Tycho Brahe's improved instruments made precise observations of the skies (1576\u20131601), and from these Johannes Kepler\nDocument [1](Title: Geocentric model) The astronomical predictions of Ptolemy's geocentric model were used to prepare astrological and astronomical charts for over 1500 years.  The geocentric model held sway into the early modern age, but from the late 16th century onward, it was gradually superseded by the Heliocentric model of Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler. There was much resistance to the transition between these two theories. Christian theologians were reluctant to reject a theory that agreed with Bible passages (e.g. \"Sun, stand you still upon Gibeon\", Joshua 10:12).

The concept that the continents once formed a continuous land mass was first proposed by Alfred Wegener, the originator of the scientific theory of continental drift, in his 1912 publication \"The Origin of Continents\" (\"Die Entstehung der Kontinente\"). He expanded upon his hypothesis in his 1915 book \"The Origin of Continents and Oceans\" (\"Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane\"), in which he postulated that, before breaking up and drifting to their present locations, all the continents had formed a single supercontinent that he called the \"\"Urkontinent\"\". The name \"Pangea\" occurs in the 1920 edition of \"Die Entstehung der\nDocument [6](Title: Antarctica) the north\". For example, the short-lived French colony established in Brazil in the 16th century was called \"France Antarctique\". The first formal use of the name \"Antarctica\" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish cartographer John George Bartholomew. The long-imagined (but undiscovered) south polar continent was originally called \"Terra Australis\", sometimes shortened to 'Australia' as seen in a woodcut illustration titled \"Sphere of the winds\", contained in an astrological textbook published in Frankfurt in 1545. Although the longer Latin phrase was better known, the shortened name \"Australia\" was used in Europe's scholarly circles. Then in\nDocument [7](Title: Naming of the Americas) unitary continent, the form is generally \"the continent of America\" in the singular. However, without a clarifying context, singular \"America\" in English commonly refers to the United States of America. The earliest known use of the name \"America\" dates to April 25, 1507, where it was applied to what is now known as South America. It appears on a small globe map with twelve time zones, together with the largest wall map made to date, both created by the German cartographer Martin Waldseem\u00fcller in Saint-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges in France. These were the first maps to show the Americas as a land mass\nDocument [8](Title: Terra Australis) Incognita (\"the unknown land of the south\") or Terra Australis Nondum Cognita (\"the southern land not yet known\"). Other names were Brasiliae Australis (\"the south of Brazil\"), and Magellanica (\"the land of Magellan\"). During the eighteenth century, today's Australia was not conflated with \"Terra Australis\", as it sometimes was in the twentieth century. Captain Cook and his contemporaries knew that the fifth continent (today's Australia), which they called \"New Holland\", was entirely separate from the imagined (but still undiscovered) sixth continent (today's Antarctica), which they called \"the Southern Continent\" or \"Terra Australis\", sometimes shortened to \"Australia\". In the nineteenth century,\nDocument [9](Title: North America) Vespucci, who explored South America between 1497 and 1502, was the first European to suggest that the Americas were not the East Indies, but a different landmass previously unknown by Europeans. In 1507, Waldseem\u00fcller produced a world map, in which he placed the word \"America\" on the continent of South America, in the middle of what is today Brazil. He explained the rationale for the name in the accompanying book \"Cosmographiae Introductio\": For Waldseem\u00fcller, no one should object to the naming of the land after its discoverer. He used the Latinized version of Vespucci's name (Americus Vespucius), but in its\nDocument [10](Title: Francesco Rosselli) and other early maps. However, the Antarctic continent was not discovered until the early 19th century. There are many maps from the 15th to the 18th century showing \"Terra Australis Incognita\" (\"unknown land in the south\"), the continent that should have been there, according to the Greek philosophers from Pythagoras onwards. They had worked out that the Earth was spherical, and had even calculated its diameter within a good degree of precision (Eratosthenes, in the 3rd century BCE), and thought that, as there were lands in the northern hemisphere, there should be lands in the southern hemisphere too, lest the\nDocument [1](Title: Pangaea) Pangaea or Pangea ( /p\u00e6n\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0\u0259/) was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras. It assembled from earlier continental units approximately 335 million years ago, and it began to break apart about 175 million years ago. In contrast to the present Earth and its distribution of continental mass, much of Pangaea was in the southern hemisphere and surrounded by a superocean, Panthalassa. Pangaea was the most recent supercontinent to have existed and the first to be reconstructed by geologists.\n\nQuestion: what was the name of the first continent\nAnswer:", "model_answer": " According to Document [2], the name of the first continent discovered by Europeans was \"Mundus Novus,\" which was credited to Vespucci in 1502 or 1503.

One of the most memorable aspects of the show that was developed during the first season was the transformation sequence that changed Diana Prince into her superheroine alter ego. The sequence in the original specials employed a slow fade between two synchronized shots, both filmed with an overcranked camera to create a slow motion effect. A twirling Diana Prince's\nDocument [6](Title: Wonder Woman (TV series)) \"Justice League Unlimited.\" (Prior to the series in which Carter starred, the transformation was depicted in the comics by way of Diana spinning her magic lasso around her body, with the lasso changing her clothes, or by simply changing at super-human speed.)

This allowed them to be shot without a locked off camera at more convenient points in the production schedule, when Carter\nDocument [7](Title: Wonder Woman (TV series)) with the first Steve Trevor, the producers chose to drop any suggestion that Steve Jr. and Wonder Woman were anything more than good friends. Indeed, when an impostor posing as Steve Jr. attempted to seduce Diana, she made it quite clear that she had no sexual interest in him. Executive producer Douglas S. Cramer noted the difficulties in maintaining long-term romantic tension between leads, because the resolution of that romantic tension often results in the cancellation of the series.

Diana, Steve and Joe Atkinson (Norman Burton), a weathered IADC agent, received their orders from a \"Charlie's Angels-like\" character who is heard but never seen.

For the role of Steve Trevor, the producers chose Lyle Waggoner, despite his dark brown, almost-black, hair not matching the comic's blond Trevor, who at the time was better known as a comedic actor after several years co-starring in \"The Carol Burnett Show.\" He was also known to Ross as having been one of the leading candidates to play Batman a decade earlier, but instead Adam West was signed.

The original Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1935, and the current version of the Act, as amended, encompasses several social welfare and social insurance programs. Social Security is funded primarily through payroll taxes called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax (SECA). Tax deposits are collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and are formally\nDocument [9](Title: History of Social Security in the United States) poverty, unemployment, and the burdens of widows and fatherless children. By signing this Act on August 14, 1935, President Roosevelt became the first president to advocate federal assistance for the elderly. The Act provided benefits to retirees and the unemployed, and a lump-sum benefit at death. Payments to current retirees are financed by a payroll tax on current workers' wages, half directly as a payroll tax and half paid by the employer. The act also gave money to states to provide assistance to aged individuals (Title I), for unemployment insurance (Title III), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (Title IV),\nDocument [10](Title: History of Social Security in the United States) wage earning among men and women in the Social Security system. History of Social Security in the United States A limited form of the Social Security program began as a measure to implement \"social insurance\" during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when poverty rates among senior citizens exceeded 50 percent. The Social Security Act was enacted August 14, 1935. The Act was drafted during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term by the President's Committee on Economic Security, under Frances Perkins, and passed by Congress as part of the New Deal. The Act was an attempt to limit what were\nDocument [1](Title: Social Security Amendments of 1965) The legislation made two amendments to the Social Security Act of 1935.

The private identity\nDocument [4](Title: SIP extensions for the IP Multimedia Subsystem) extensions is not restricted to the IMS framework. The 3GPP has stated several general requirements stated for operation of the IMS. These include an efficient use of the radio interface by minimizing the exchange of signaling messages between the mobile terminal and the network, a minimum session setup time by performing tasks prior to session establishment instead of during session establishment, a minimum support required in the terminal, the support for roaming and non-roaming scenarios with terminal mobility management (supported by the access network, not SIP), and support for IPv6 addressing. Other requirements involve protocol extensions, such as SIP header\nDocument [5](Title: SIP extensions for the IP Multimedia Subsystem) resource reservation on its side. Subsequent UPDATE requests are sent to inform about the reservation progress, and they are answered by 2XX response codes. In a typical offer/answer exchange, one UPDATE will be sent by the calling party when its reservation is completed, then the called party will respond and eventually finish allocating the resources. It is then, when all the resources for the call are in place, when the caller is alerted. In the IMS framework it is fundamental to handle user identities for authentication, authorization and accounting purposes. The IMS is meant to provide multimedia services over IP\nDocument [6](Title: SIP extensions for the IP Multimedia Subsystem) to negotiate and allocate the call resources before the called party is alerted. In the IMS framework, it is required that once the callee is alerted, the chances of a session failure are minimum. An important source of failure is the inability to reserve network resources to support the session, so these resources should be allocated before the phone rings. However, in the IMS, to reserve resources the network needs to know the callee's IP address, port and session parameters and therefore it is necessary that the initial offer/answer exchange to establish a session has started (INVITE request).

In 2011, TISPAN published the specification of a functional architecture for Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and is now working on the specification of the protocols applicable to the reference points identified in this architecture (See ETSI TS 182 019) The ETSI website on Next Generation Networking states: \"\"Standards for fixed NGN were developed by the now closed ETSI technical committee TISPAN.

These extensions are based on Request for Comments (RFC) protocol recommendations by the IETF. The 3GPP, which is a collaboration between groups of telecommunications associations aimed at developing and maintaining the IMS, stated a series of requirements for SIP to be successfully used in the IMS. Some of them could be addressed by using existing capabilities and extensions in SIP while, in other cases, the 3GPP had to collaborate with the IETF to standardize new SIP extensions to meet the new requirements. In any case, the IETF evolves SIP in a generic basis, so that the use of its\nDocument [9](Title: SIP extensions for the IP Multimedia Subsystem) configured to relay messages across both networks according to these recommendations, user agents will need to implement extensions so that they can directly exchange media streams. These extensions are related to the Session Description Protocol offer/answer initial exchange, that will be used to gather the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of both ends so that they can establish a direct communication. Apart from all the explained extensions to SIP that make it possible for the IMS to work successfully, it is also necessary that the IMS framework interworks and exchanges services with existing network infrastructures, mainly the Public switched telephone network\nDocument [10](Title: SIP extensions for the IP Multimedia Subsystem) a format used to describe streaming media initialization parameters, carried in the body of SIP messages. The new SDP attributes are meant to describe the \"current status\" of the resource reservation, the \"desired status\" of the reservation to proceed with session establishment, and the \"confirmation status\", to indicate when the reservation status should be confirmed. In the IMS, the initial session parameter negotiation can be done by using the provisional responses and session description updating extensions, along with SDP in the body of the messages. The first offer, described by means of SDP, can be carried by the INVITE request\nDocument [1](Title: IP Multimedia Subsystem) To ease the integration with the Internet, IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible, e.g., SIP (Session Initiation Protocol).  According to the 3GPP, IMS is not intended to standardize applications, but rather to aid the access of multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals, i.e., to create a form of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). This is done by having a horizontal control layer that isolates the access network from the service layer. From a logical architecture perspective, services need not have their own control functions, as the control layer is a common horizontal layer.

After Enver's 22 July approach to Germany had been rejected, Kaiser Wilhelm II ordered that it be reconsidered. Renewed negotiations started on 28 July, involving Enver, Talaat, and Said Halim Pasha.

The Ottoman army including the Ottoman air force was demobilized, and all ports, railways, and other strategic points were made available for use by the Allies. In the Caucasus, the Ottomans had to retreat to within the pre-war borders between the Ottoman and the Russian Empires. The armistice was followed by the occupation of Constantinople (Istanbul) and the subsequent partitioning of the Ottoman Empire.

No type specimens are known; the specimen described by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743) is no longer extant. Subsequent generic names used for the crown-of-thorns starfish included \"Stellonia\", \"Echinaster\" and \"Echinites\", before settling on \"Acanthaster\" (Gervais 1841). Species names included \"echintes\", \"solaris\", \"mauritensis\", \"ellisii\", and \"ellisii pseudoplanci\" (with subspecies).

The body form of the crown-of-thorns starfish is fundamentally the same as that of a typical starfish, with a central disk and radiating arms. Its special traits, however, include being disc-shaped, multiple-armed, flexible, prehensile, and heavily spined, and having a large ratio of stomach surface to body mass. Its prehensile ability arises from the two rows of numerous tube feet that extend to the tip of each arm.

The starfish were observed to spawn (photograph) from December to January (early to mid-summer) in this region with most observations being in January.
