After Dingiswayo was captured and executed by Zwide, the Mthethwa people placed themselves under Shaka and took the Zulu name. Shaka revolutionized traditional ways of fighting by introducing the assegai, a short stabbing spear, as a weapon and by organizing warriors into disciplined units that fought in close formation behind large cowhide shields.

Numerous ethnic European colonists were entering the area from the Cape Colony, and they possessed guns and weaponry far superior to the Zulu spear. Dingane lacked Shaka's military and leadership skills; rebel chiefs broke away from his rule. Their dissension was exacerbated by armed conflict with the newly arrived Voortrekkers.

Through traffic on US 93 combined with pedestrian and tourist traffic at Hoover Dam itself led to major traffic congestion on the dam and on the approaches to the dam. The approaches featured hairpin turns on both the Nevada and Arizona sides of the dam, and the terrain caused limited sight distances around curves.

Bacteria select their electron transport chains from a DNA library containing multiple possible dehydrogenases, terminal oxidases and terminal reductases. The situation is often summarized by saying that electron transport chains in bacteria are \"branched\", \"modular\", and \"inducible\". In oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are transferred from a low-energy electron donor (e.g., NADH) to an acceptor (e.g., O) through an electron transport chain. In photophosphorylation, the energy of sunlight is used to \"create\" a high-energy electron donor and an electron acceptor. Electrons are then transferred from the donor\nDocument [3](Title: Electron transport chain) to the acceptor through another electron transport chain. Photosynthetic electron transport chains have many similarities to the oxidative chains discussed above. They use mobile, lipid-soluble carriers (quinones) and mobile, water-soluble carriers (cytochromes, etc.). They also contain a proton pump. It is remarkable that the proton pump in \"all\" photosynthetic chains resembles mitochondrial \"Complex III\".

Electron transport chains are used for extracting energy via redox reactions from sunlight in photosynthesis or, such as in the case of the oxidation of sugars, cellular respiration. In eukaryotes, an important electron transport chain is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane where it serves as the site of oxidative phosphorylation through the action of ATP synthase.

A small percentage of electrons do not complete the whole series and instead directly leak to oxygen, resulting in the formation of the free-radical superoxide, a highly reactive molecule that contributes to oxidative stress and has been implicated in a number of diseases and aging. Energy obtained through the transfer of electrons down the ETC is used to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical proton gradient (\u0394pH) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM).

In the electron transport chain, electrons are passed through a series of proteins via oxidation-reduction reactions, with each acceptor protein along the chain having a greater reduction potential than the previous. The last destination for an electron along this chain is an oxygen molecule. In normal conditions, the oxygen is reduced to produce water; however, in about 0.1\u20132% of electrons passing through the chain (this number derives from studies in isolated mitochondria, though the exact rate in live organisms is yet to be fully agreed upon), oxygen is instead prematurely and incompletely reduced to give the superoxide radical (),\nDocument [8](Title: Adenosine diphosphate) electrons from NADH or FADH2 to O2 through electron carriers. The energy released when electrons are passed from higher-energy NADH or FADH2 to the lower-energy O2 is required to phosphorylate ADP and once again generate ATP. It is this energy coupling and phosphorylation of ADP to ATP that gives the electron transport chain the name oxidative phosphorylation. During the initial phases of glycolysis and the TCA cycle, cofactors such as NAD+ donate and accept electrons that aid in the electron transport chain's ability to produce a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane.

SCSI drives provide greater sustained throughput than multiple SATA drives connected via a simple (i.e., command-based) port multiplier because of disconnect-reconnect and aggregating performance.

The photoreceptor layer must be embedded in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which performs at least seven vital functions, one of the most obvious being to supply oxygen and other necessary nutrients needed for the photoreceptors to function. These nutrients include glucose, fatty acids, and retinal.

Additional gradients are formed within the retina that aid in proper targeting of RGC axons that function to establish the retinotopic map. The retina is stratified into distinct layers, each containing specific cell types or cellular compartments that have metabolisms with different nutritional requirements. To satisfy these requirements, the ophthalmic artery bifurcates and supplies the retina via two distinct vascular networks: the choroidal network, which supplies the choroid and the outer retina, and the retinal network, which supplies the retina's inner layer. At first glance, one may think that the vertebrate retina\nDocument [4](Title: Conjunctiva) Conjunctiva The conjunctiva lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the sclera (the white of the eye). It is composed of non-keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium with goblet cells, and also stratified columnar epithelium. The conjunctiva is highly vascularised, with many microvessels easily accessible for imaging studies. The conjunctiva is typically divided into three parts: Blood to the bulbar conjunctiva is primarily derived from the ophthalmic artery. The blood supply to the palpebral conjunctiva (the eyelid) is derived from the external carotid artery. However, the circulation of the bulbar conjunctiva and palpebral conjunctiva are linked, so both bulbar conjunctival and\nDocument [5](Title: Retina) damage and allows the photoreceptor cells to have decades-long useful lives. The bird retina is devoid of blood vessels, perhaps to give unobscured passage of light for forming images, thus giving better resolution. It is, therefore, a considered view that the bird retina depends for nutrition and oxygen supply on a specialized organ, called the \"pecten\" or pecten oculi, located on the blind spot or optic disk. This organ is extremely rich in blood vessels and is thought to supply nutrition and oxygen to the bird retina by diffusion through the vitreous body. The pecten is highly rich in alkaline\nDocument [6](Title: Blood\u2013retinal barrier) Blood\u2013retinal barrier The blood\u2013retinal barrier, or the BRB, is part of the blood\u2013ocular barrier that consists of cells that are joined tightly together to prevent certain substances from entering the tissue of the retina. It consists of non-fenestrated capillaries of the retinal circulation and tight-junctions between retinal epithelial cells preventing passage of large molecules from choriocapillaris into the retina. The blood retinal barrier has two components: the retinal vascular endothelium and the retinal pigment epithelium. Retinal blood vessels that are similar to cerebral blood vessels maintain the inner blood-ocular barrier. This physiological barrier comprises a single layer of non-fenestrated endothelial\nDocument [7](Title: Ophthalmic artery) and supply the eyelids. The OA terminates in two branches, the supratrochlear (or frontal) artery and the dorsal nasal artery. Both exit the orbit medially to supply the forehead and scalp. Because of the obvious importance of the ocular globe, branches of the ophthalmic artery often are subdivided into two groups: those that supply the eyeball (ocular group) and those that supply non-ocular orbital structures (orbital group). The orbital group, distributing vessels to the orbit and surrounding parts, includes: The ocular group, distributing vessels to the eye and its muscles, includes: Branches of the ophthalmic artery supply: Severe occlusion of\nDocument [8](Title: Retina) lies beyond the RPE. The choroid supplies about 75% of these nutrients to the retina and the retinal vasculature only 25%. When light strikes 11-cis-retinal (in the disks in the rods and cones), 11-cis-retinal changes to all-trans-retinal which then triggers changes in the opsins. Now, the outer segments do not regenerate the retinal back into the cis- form once it has been changed by light. Instead the retinal is pumped out to the surrounding RPE where it is regenerated and transported back into the outer segments of the photoreceptors. This recycling function of the RPE protects the photoreceptors against photo-oxidative\nDocument [9](Title: Conjunctiva) palpebral conjunctival vessels will be supplied by both the ophthalmic artery and the external carotid artery, to varying extents. Sensory innervation of the conjunctiva is divided into four parts: The conjunctiva consists of non-keratinized, both stratified squamous and stratified columnar epithelium, with interspersed goblet cells. The epithelial layer contains blood vessels, fibrous tissue, and lymphatic channels. Accessory lacrimal glands in the conjunctiva constantly produce the aqueous portion of tears. Additional cells present in the conjunctival epithelium include melanocytes, T and B cell lymphocytes. The conjunctiva helps lubricate the eye by producing mucus and tears, although a smaller volume of tears\nDocument [10](Title: Retinal haemorrhage) Retinal haemorrhage Retinal haemorrhage is a disorder of the eye in which bleeding occurs in the retina, the light sensitive tissue, located on the back wall of the eye. There are photoreceptor cells in the retina called rods and cones, which transduce light energy into nerve signals that can be processed by the brain to form visual images. Retinal hemorrhage can affect adults, and newborn babies and infants may also suffer from this disorder. A retinal hemorrhage can be caused by several medical conditions such as hypertension, retinal vein occlusion (a blockage of a retinal vein), anemia, leukemia or diabetes\nDocument [11](Title: Central retinal artery) This is the basis of the famous \"Cherry red spot\" seen on examination of the retina on funduscopy of a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).

The hepatic arteries supply arterial blood to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its blood flow. Oxygen is provided from both sources; about half of the liver's oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the hepatic arteries. The hepatic artery also has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors; therefore, flow through the artery is controlled, in part, by the splanchnic nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Blood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties into the\nDocument [13](Title: Retinohypothalamic tract) melatonin. The retinohypothalamic tract consists of retinal ganglion cells. A distinct population of ganglion cells, known as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), is critically responsible for providing non-image-forming visual signals to the brain. Only about two percent of all retinal ganglion cells are ipRGCs, whose cell bodies are in mainly the ganglion cell layer (and some are displaced in the inner nuclear layer of the retina). The photopigment melanopsin is present on the dendrites of ipRGCs, giving ipRGCs sensitivity to light in the absence of rod or cone input. The dendrites spread outwards from ipRGCs within the inner plexiform\nDocument [14](Title: Blood\u2013retinal barrier) cells, which have tight junctions. These junctions are impervious to tracer, so many substances can affect the metabolism of the eyeball. The retinal pigment epithelium maintains the outer blood\u2013retinal barrier. Diabetic retinopathy, eye damage that frequently occurs as a result of diabetes, is related to the breakdown of the blood\u2013retinal barrier. The barrier becomes more leaky in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Animal models have shown that the blood\u2013retinal barrier becomes more permeable to substances in hypertensive animals (those with high blood pressure).

No type specimens are known; the specimen described by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743) is no longer extant. Subsequent generic names used for the crown-of-thorns starfish included \"Stellonia\", \"Echinaster\" and \"Echinites\", before settling on \"Acanthaster\" (Gervais 1841). Species names included \"echintes\", \"solaris\", \"mauritensis\", \"ellisii\", and \"ellisii pseudoplanci\" (with subspecies).

The body form of the crown-of-thorns starfish is fundamentally the same as that of a typical starfish, with a central disk and radiating arms. Its special traits, however, include being disc-shaped, multiple-armed, flexible, prehensile, and heavily spined, and having a large ratio of stomach surface to body mass. Its prehensile ability arises from the two rows of numerous tube feet that extend to the tip of each arm.

It gives the impression of living in a habitat where having sharp defenses against predators has little value, although it lives on coral reef and feeds on coral.

(1993) monitored changes in fecundity and fertility (fertilisation rate) over the spawning season of the Crown-of-thorns starfish on Davies Reef, central Great Barrier Reef, from 1990 to 1992. The starfish were observed to spawn (photograph) from December to January (early to mid-summer) in this region with most observations being in January. However, both gonadosomatic index and fertility peaked early and declined to low levels by late January, indicating that most successful reproductive events took place early in the spawning season.

A study, however, based on the stomach contents of large carnivorous fish that are potential predators of\nDocument [9](Title: Crown-of-thorns starfish) was an initial period of relatively slow growth while the starfish were feeding on coralline algae. This was followed by a phase of rapid growth which led to sexual maturity at the end of the second year. The starfish were in the vicinity of 200 mm diameter at this stage. They continued to grow rapidly and were in the order of 300 mm at 3 years of age. Then they reached a plateau between 3 and 4 years and tended to decline after 4 years.

Those, however, off northern Western Australia had a strong Pacific affinity. With the exception of the very strong connection of southern Japanese populations to the Great Barrier Reef populations, the patterns of variation within regions were consistent with isolation by distance. Again, the pattern of decreasing levels of successful larval dispersal over long distances is apparent. Benzie suggests that the divergence between Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean populations began at least 1.6 million years ago and is likely to reflect responses to changes in climate and sea level.

Since the larvae are the most abundant stages of development it is likely that changes in survival will be most importance during this phase of development. Temperature and salinity have little effect on the survival of crown-of-thorns larvae. However, abundance and species of the particular component of phytoplankton (unicellular flagellates) on which the larvae feed has a profound effect on survival and rate of growth.

Juvenile \"A. planci\" that had reached the stage of feeding on coral were then reared for some years in the same large closed-circuit seawater system that was used for the early juveniles. They were moved to larger tanks and kept supplied with coral so that food was not a limiting factor on growth rate. The growth curves of size versus age were sigmoidal, as seen in majority marine invertebrates. There\nDocument [13](Title: Crown-of-thorns starfish) this symmetry.

The underside of each arm has a series of closely fitting plates which form a groove and extend in rows to the mouth. They are usually of subdued colours, pale brown to grey-green, but they may be garish with bright warning colours in some parts of their wide range. The long, sharp\nDocument [14](Title: Crown-of-thorns starfish) was observed between degree of genetic differentiation and geographic distance, suggesting the genetic homogeneity among \"A. planci\" populations is due to gene flow by planktonic larval dispersion. The distance effect on genetic differentiation most probably reflects decreasing levels of successful larval dispersal over long distances. In view of the level of macrogeographic homogeneity, significant allele frequency differences were observed between adjacent populations separated by approximately 10 km. The Hawaiian population was most differentiated from other populations. Treating the morphologically distinctive, eastern Pacific \"Acanthaster\" as a separate species, \"A. ellisii\", is not supported by these data.

Some ecologists suggest that the starfish has an important and active role in maintaining coral reef biodiversity, driving ecological succession. Before overpopulation became a significant issue, crown-of-thorns prevented fast-growing coral from overpowering the slower growing coral varieties. At high densities ('outbreaks', 'plagues'), which may be defined as when the starfish are too abundant for the coral food supply, coral cover goes into decline. The starfish must broaden their diet from their preferred species, colony size and shape. The starfish often aggregate during feeding, even\nDocument [16](Title: Crown-of-thorns starfish) recruitment on reefs downstream to which the larvae are carried and then settle. Population numbers for the crown-of-thorns have been increasing since the 1970s. However, historic records of distribution patterns and numbers are hard to come by, as SCUBA technology, necessary to conduct population censuses, had only been developed in the previous few decades. To prevent overpopulation of crown-of-thorns causing widespread destruction to coral reef habitats, humans have implemented a variety of control measures. Manual removals have been successful, but are relatively labour-intensive. Injecting sodium bisulphate into the starfish is the most efficient measure in practice. Sodium bisulphate is deadly\nDocument [17](Title: Crown-of-thorns starfish) ward off the starfish as it seeks to spread its stomach over the coral surface. In reef areas of low densities of hard coral, reflecting the nature of the reef community or due to feeding by high density crown-of-thorns, the starfish may be found feeding on soft corals (Alcyonacea). The starfish are cryptic in behavior during their first two years, emerging at night to feed. They usually remain so as adults when solitary. The only evidence of a hidden individual may be white feeding scars on adjacent coral. However, their behavior changes under two circumstances: The elongated sharp spines covering\nDocument [18](Title: Environmental threats to the Great Barrier Reef) individual adult of this species can eat up to six square meters of living reef in a single year.

Ammonium ion is added forming an imine and releasing ammonia. The imine goes through hydrolysis to form the\nDocument [1](Title: Dipeptide) A dipeptide is a sometimes ambiguous designation of two classes of organic compounds: Its molecules contain either two amino acids joined by a single peptide bond or one amino acid with two peptide bonds.\nDocument [12](Title: Formose reaction) of 3 with formaldehyde produces tetrulose (6), which undergoes another ketose-aldose isomerization to form aldotetrose 7 (either threose or erythrose).

During this process, 3 can also react with 1 to form ribulose (4), which can isomerize to give rise to ribose (5), an important building block of ribonucleic acid.

Dipeptides activate G-cells found in the stomach to secrete gastrin. In this usage, \"X dipeptide\" is taken literally: One amino acid \"X\" is equipped with two minimal peptide bonds: The C terminus COOH becomes COCH, the N terminus NH becomes NHCH. For instance, alanine dipeptide is CHCONHCH(CH)CONHCH. Dipeptide A dipeptide is an organic compound derived from two amino acids. The amino acids can be the same or different.

A large arsenal of chemical tools is now available for the synthesis of almost all peptides up to 40 amino acid residues. However, several small-size peptides and many large peptides and/or proteins are still unavailable by classical methods. Recently, an efficient stepwise solid-phase synthesis of RANTES (24-91) was published. RANTES is a major HIV-suppressive factor produced by CD8+ T Cells.

Ketenes (of the general formula RRC=C=O) have many parallels to isocyanates (of the general formula R-N=C=O) in their constitution as well as in their reactivity. Diphenyl ketene reacts with water in an addition reaction to form diphenylacetic acid, with ethanol to diphenyl acetic ethyl ester or with ammonia to the corresponding amide. Carboxylic acids produce mixed anhydrides of diphenylacetic acid, which can be used to activate protected amino acids for peptide linkage. The protected dipeptide Z-Leu-Phe-OEt (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine ethyl ester) is thus obtained in 59% yield via the\nDocument [18](Title: Formylation) of purines. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzymes glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) transformylase and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribotide (AICAR) transformylase. More recently, formylation has been discovered to be a histone modification, which may modulate gene expression. Formylation refers to any chemical processes in which a compound is functionalized with a formyl group (-CH=O). In organic chemistry, the term is most commonly used with regards to aromatic compounds (for example the conversion of benzene to benzaldehyde in the Gattermann\u2013Koch reaction). In biochemistry the reaction is catalysed by enzymes such as formyltransferases. Formylation of methanofuran initiates the methanogenesis cycle.

If the substrate under nucleophilic attack is chiral, then this often leads to inversion of configuration (stereochemistry), called a Walden inversion. In an example of the S2 reaction, the attack of Br (the nucleophile) on an ethyl chloride (the electrophile) results in ethyl bromide, with chloride ejected as the leaving group.: S2 attack occurs if the backside route of attack is not sterically hindered by substituents on the substrate.

While dipolarophiles are typically \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, there have been many recent advances in developing new types of dipolarophiles. When the dipole and dipolarophile are part of the same molecule, an intramolecular cyclization reaction can lead to a polycyclic product of considerable complexity. If the dipolarophile is tethered to a carbon of the dipole, a fused bicycle is formed. If it is tethered to the nitrogen, a bridged structure results. The intramolecular nature of the reaction can also be useful in that regioselectivity is often constrained. Another advantage to intramolecular reactions is that the dipolarophile\n\nQuestion: what type of reaction occurs to form a dipeptide\nAnswer:", "model_answer": " Based on the provided search results, dipeptides are formed through various reactions, including:\n\n1.

The statement can be used to help show the status of a company.\nDocument [12](Title: Statement of changes in financial position) Statement of changes in financial position In business accounting, the statement of change in financial position is a financial statement that outlines the sources and uses of funds and explains any changes in cash or working capital. It contains activities from operations that alter the cash of a company has on hand. Changes in financial position include cash outflows, such as capital expenditures, and cash inflows, such as revenue. It may also include certain non-cash changes, such as depreciation. The use of this statement is to provide relevant and focused on a period, so that users of financial statements with\nDocument [13](Title: Financial ratio) home countries, but private companies, partnerships and sole proprietorships may not use accrual basis accounting. Large multi-national corporations may use International Financial Reporting Standards to produce their financial statements, or they may use the generally accepted accounting principles of their home country. There is no international standard for calculating the summary data presented in all financial statements, and the terminology is not always consistent between companies, industries, countries and time periods. Various abbreviations may be used in financial statements, especially financial statements summarized on the Internet.

The rules for the recording, measurement and presentation of government financial statements may be different from those required for business and even for non-profit organizations. They may use either of two accounting methods:\nDocument [15](Title: Forensic accountant) retained earnings or the equity statement, reconciles the beginning and ending retained earnings for the period, using information such as net income from the other financial statements. The statement of cash flows lists the sources and uses of cash and divides them into operating, investing, and financing activities.

Personal accounts are accounts relating to persons or organisations with whom the business has transactions and will mainly consist of accounts of debtors and creditors. Nominal accounts are revenue, expenses, gains, and losses. Transactions are entered in the books of accounts by applying the following golden rules of accounting: This approach is also called the American approach. Under this approach transactions are recorded based on the accounting equation, i.e., Assets = Liabilities + Capital. The accounting equation is a statement of equality between the debits and the credits. The\nDocument [17](Title: Accounting equation) of a firm\u2019s assets. However, due to the fact that accounting is kept on a historical basis, the equity is typically not the net worth of the organization. Often a company may depreciate capital assets in 5-7 years. Then those assets have a zero book value. They are fully depreciated. That is however typically not their \"worth\" Due to its role in determining a firm\u2019s net worth, the accounting equation is an important tool for investors looking to measure a company\u2019s holdings and debts at any particular time, and frequent calculations can indicate how steady or erratic a business\u2019s financial\nDocument [18](Title: Income statement) Income statement An income statement or profit and loss account (also referred to as a profit and loss statement (P&L), statement of profit or loss, revenue statement, statement of financial performance, earnings statement, operating statement, or statement of operations) is one of the financial statements of a company and shows the company\u2019s revenues and expenses during a particular period.

Despite this, by 1989 computer usage shifted from being a relative rarity in American public schools, to being present in nearly every school district. The early 1990s marked the beginning of modern media technology such as CD-ROMs as well as the development of modern presentation software such as Microsoft PowerPoint. Other computer-based technology including the electronic whiteboard and the laptop computer became widely available to students.

The study also concluded that computers proved to be very popular with students, and that applications run on early models included sports statistic managers, administration tools, and physics simulators. In 1975, Apple Inc. began donating Apple 1 model computers to schools, and mainframes began to lose their former dominance over academic research.

In the United Kingdom, the BBC Computer Literacy Project and the BBC Micro, which ran from 1980 to 1989, educated a generation of coders in schools and at home, prior to the development of mass market PCs in the 1990s. The ZX Spectrum, released in 1982, helped to popularize home computing, coding and gaming in Britain and was also popular in other countries.

Between 1997 and 1999, the ratio of students to multimedia computers decreased from 21 students per machine to less than 10 students per machine. Colleges began creating specialized classrooms designed to provide students with access to the utilization of the most modern technology available. Classrooms such as the \"Classroom 2000\" built at Georgia Tech in 1999 which featured computers with audio and video equipment designed to capture detailed recordings of lectures as a replacement for traditional note taking began to become more common.

Another change from the home computer era is that the once-common endeavour of writing one's own software programs has almost vanished from home computer use. As early as 1965, some experimental projects such as Jim Sutherland's explored the possible utility of a computer in the home. In 1969, the Honeywell Kitchen Computer was marketed as a luxury gift item, and would have inaugurated the era of home computing, but none were sold.

Governments around the world began to take notice of the effectiveness of this policy, and began financial initiatives to significantly increase the use of laptop computers in other colleges as well. In 1996, Bill Clinton made over $2 billion in grants available in the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, a program which challenged schools to make computers available to every student, connected to the outside world, and engaging.
