A 1998 study found that random physical punishment (not proper formal corporal punishment) was being used extensively by teachers in Egypt to punish behavior they regarded as unacceptable. Around 80% of the boys and 60% of the girls were punished by teachers, using their hands, sticks, straps, shoes, punches and kicks as most common methods of administration.

Lymphoid tissue associated with the lymphatic system is concerned with immune functions in defending the body against infections and the spread of tumours. It consists of connective tissue formed of reticular fibers, with various types of leukocytes, (white blood cells), mostly lymphocytes enmeshed in it, through which the lymph passes. Regions of the lymphoid tissue that are densely packed with lymphocytes are known as \"lymphoid follicles\". Lymphoid tissue can either be structurally well organized as lymph nodes or may consist\nDocument [7](Title: Lymphatic vessel) Lymphatic vessel The lymphatic vessels (or lymph vessels or lymphatics) are thin-walled vessels (tubes) structured like blood vessels, that carry lymph. As part of the lymphatic system, lymph vessels are complementary to the cardiovascular system. Lymph vessels are lined by endothelial cells, and have a thin layer of smooth muscle, and adventitia that bind the lymph vessels to the surrounding tissue. Lymph vessels are devoted to the propulsion of the lymph from the lymph capillaries, which are mainly concerned with absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues. Lymph capillaries are slightly larger than their counterpart capillaries of the vascular system.\nDocument [8](Title: Lymph capillary) Lymph capillary Lymph capillaries or lymphatic capillaries are tiny, thin-walled microvessels located in the spaces between cells (except in the central nervous system and non-vascular tissues) which serve to drain and process extracellular fluid. Upon entering the lumen of a lymphatic capillary, the collected fluid and associated cells (notably white blood cells) is known as lymph. Each lymphatic capillary carries lymph into a lymphatic vessel, which in turn connects to a lymph node. Lymph is ultimately returned to the venous circulation. Lymphatic capillaries are slightly larger in diameter than blood capillaries, and have closed ends (unlike the loop structure of\nDocument [9](Title: Lymphatic vessel) (caliber) of the lumen. The outermost layer is the adventitia that consists of fibrous tissue. The general structure described here is seen only in larger lymphatics; smaller lymphatics have fewer layers. The smallest vessels (\"lymphatic\" or \"lymph capillaries\") lack both the muscular layer and the outer adventitia. As they proceed forward and in their course are joined by other capillaries, they grow larger and first take on an adventitia, and then smooth muscles. The lymphatic conducting system broadly consists of two types of channels\u2014the \"initial lymphatics\", the \"prelymphatics\" or \"lymph capillaries\" that specialize in collection of the lymph from the\nDocument [10](Title: Lymphatic vessel) Lymph vessels that carry lymph to a lymph node are called afferent lymph vessels, and those that carry it from a lymph node are called efferent lymph vessels, from where the lymph may travel to another lymph node, may be returned to a vein, or may travel to a larger lymph duct. Lymph ducts drain the lymph into one of the subclavian veins and thus return it to general circulation. Generally, lymph flows away from the tissues to lymph nodes and eventually to either the right lymphatic duct or the largest lymph vessel in the body, the thoracic duct.

With the British in control of most northern coastal cities and Patriot forces in control of the hinterlands, the British attempted to force a result by a campaign to seize the southern states. With limited regular troops at their disposal, the British commanders realized that success depended on a large-scale mobilization of Loyalists.

It is not a government agency, but a non-profit membership business advocacy organization. The Chamber is staffed with policy experts, lobbyists and business advocates. Politically, the Chamber is generally considered to be a conservative organization, but is non-partisan and works across party lines to work in the interest of the entire Illinois business community.

Business owners in towns and cities form these local societies to advocate on behalf of the business community. Local businesses are members, and they elect a board of directors or executive council to set policy for the chamber. The board or council then hires a President, CEO or Executive Director, plus staffing appropriate to size, to run the organization.\n\nQuestion: what type of business is chamber of commerce\nAnswer:", "model_answer": " A chamber of commerce (or board of trade) is a form of business network, for example, a local organization of businesses whose goal is to further the interests of businesses.", "model": "../download/StableBeluga-7B", "model_temperature": 0, "model_top_p": "None", "model_prompt_mention_random_ordering": false, "model_use_random_ordering": false, "best_subspan_em": 1.0}

Spiritualists believed that the dead were able to contact the living and reportedly used a talking board very similar to a modern ouija board at their camps in Ohio in 1886 to ostensibly enable faster communication with spirits.\n\nQuestion: when did the ouija board first come out\nAnswer:", "model_answer": " The ouija board first came out on July 1, 1890.", "model": "../download/StableBeluga-7B", "model_temperature": 0, "model_top_p": "None", "model_prompt_mention_random_ordering": false, "model_use_random_ordering": false, "best_subspan_em": 2.0}

They are found mainly in the vicinity of open water and their usual habitat is cultivated farmland and open country but flocks will often live within cities, in markets and railway stations.\nDocument [4](Title: Common hill myna) authors favor treating the Southern hill myna (\"G. indica\") from the Nilgiris and elsewhere in the Western Ghats of India as a separate species. This is a stocky jet-black myna, with bright orange-yellow patches of naked skin and fleshy wattles on the side of its head and nape. At about 29 cm length, it is somewhat larger than the common myna (\"Acridotheres tristis\"). It is overall green-glossed black plumage, purple-tinged on the head and neck. Its large, white wing patches are obvious in flight, but mostly covered when the bird is sitting. The bill and strong legs are bright yellow,\nDocument [5](Title: Common myna) a larger yellow cheek-patch. The common myna is readily identified by the brown body, black hooded head and the bare yellow patch behind the eye. The bill and legs are bright yellow. There is a white patch on the outer primaries and the wing lining on the underside is white. The sexes are similar and birds are usually seen in pairs. The common myna obeys Gloger's rule in that the birds from northwest India tend to be paler than their darker counterparts in South India. The calls includes croaks, squawks, chirps, clicks, whistles and 'growls', and the bird often fluffs\nDocument [6](Title: Common myna) which was largely non-existent there by the 1890s. In contrast, the North Island population was able to breed more successfully and large portions of the North Island are now populated. However, in the southern reaches of the North Island, the cooler summer temperatures, like those of the South Island, have prevented the establishment of large Indian myna populations. In South Africa where it escaped into the wild in 1902, it has become very common and its distribution is greater where human populations are greater or where there is more human disturbance. The bird is also notorious for being a pest,\nDocument [7](Title: Myna) captivity. \"Myna\" is derived from the Hindi language \"main\u0101\" which itself is derived from Sanskrit \"madan\u0101\". Mynas are medium-sized passerines with strong feet. Their flight is strong and direct, and they are gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit. Plumage is typically dark, often brown, although some species have yellow head ornaments. Most species nest in holes. Some species have become well known for their imitative skills; the common hill myna is one of these. The following are species of mynas. The coleto and the two \"Saroglossa\" starlings are included because of their\nDocument [8](Title: Common hill myna) range. Elsewhere, such as on the Philippines and in Laos, the decline has been more localized. It is also becoming increasingly rare in regions of northeastern India due to capture of fledged birds for the illegal pet trade. In the Garo Hills region, however, the locals make artificial nests of a split-bamboo framework covered with grass, and put them up in accessible positions in tall trees in a forest clearing or at the edge of a small village to entice the mynas to breed there.

The species has also spread out on its own to some islands in the Pacific. Jungle mynas are long and have grey plumage, darker on the head and wings. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage. A large white wing patches on the base of the primaries becomes conspicuous in flight, and the tail feathers are broadly tipped in white.

{"question": "what was the first light beer in the us", "answers": ["Miller Lite"], "ctxs": [{"title": "Miller Lite", "text": "Miller Lite was essentially the first mainstream light beer. After its first inception as \"Gablinger's Diet Beer,\" developed in 1967 by Joseph L. Owades, PhD, a biochemist working for New York's Rheingold Brewery, the recipe was given by Owades to Chicago's Peter Hand Brewing. That year, Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors, renamed Meister Brau Brewing, and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite, a companion to their flagship Meister Brau. Under the new management, Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems, and in 1972, sold several of its existing labels to Miller. The recipe was relaunched simply as \"Lite\" on packaging and in advertising (with \"Lite Beer from Miller\" being its \"official\" name until the late '90s) in the test markets of Springfield, Illinois, Knoxville, Tennessee, and San Diego, California, in 1973, and heavily marketed using masculine pro sports players and other, so-called, macho figures of the day in an effort to sell to the key beer-drinking male demographic. Miller Lite was introduced nationally in 1975.

There was much resistance to the transition between these two theories. Christian theologians were reluctant to reject a theory that agreed with Bible passages (e.g. \"Sun, stand you still upon Gibeon\", Joshua 10:12). Others felt a new, unknown theory could not subvert an accepted consensus for geocentrism.\n\nQuestion: who is credited with developing the geocentric view\nAnswer:", "model_answer": " Anaximander, Aristarchus of Samos, and Martianus Capella are credited with developing the geocentric view.", "model": "../download/StableBeluga-7B", "model_temperature": 0, "model_top_p": "None", "model_prompt_mention_random_ordering": false, "model_use_random_ordering": false, "best_subspan_em": 1.0}

Mpande, the half-brother who had been spared from Dingane's purges, defected with 17,000 followers, and, together with Pretorius and the Voortrekkers, went to war with Dingane. Dingane was assassinated near the modern\nDocument [8](Title: History of South Africa (1815\u20131910)) establishing a republic there. Since the Zulus controlled this territory, the Voortrekker leader Piet Retief paid a visit to King Dingaan, where the suspicious Zulu promptly killed him. This killing triggered other attacks by Zulus on the Boer population, and a revenge attack by the Boers. The culmination came on 16 December 1838, in the Battle of Blood River, fought at the Ncome River in Natal.

Before encountering the British, the Zulus were first confronted with the Boers. In an attempt to form their own state as a protection against the British, the Boers began moving across the Orange River northwards.

The Treaty of S\u00e8vres was annulled in the course of the Turkish War of Independence, and the parties signed and ratified the superseding Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.

Allied military losses are placed between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 including killed, wounded, captured or missing.
