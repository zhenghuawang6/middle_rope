    "crs_R44668": "\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was created by the 1996 welfare reform law, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193). The law replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, which had provided cash assistance to needy families with children since the 1930s. The 1996 law provided both program authority and funding for TANF through the end of FY2002. Since then, extensions have been enacted to extend TANF funding and financing authority. The TANF Extension Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-4) extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019.\n\nThe 1996 welfare reform law was the culmination of a debate that had been ongoing for four decades, beginning in the 1960s. The debate focused on the role of work in reducing poverty and the extent to which cash assistance programs should encourage or discourage work. The 1996 law sought to promote work and self-sufficiency by providing a combination of cash assistance, work requirements, and work-related services.\n\nThe 1996 law created a new program, TANF, which replaced AFDC. TANF provided cash assistance to needy families with children, but it also required recipients to engage in work activities or participate in work-related activities in order to receive assistance. The law also created a new program, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which provided a refundable tax credit to low-income working families.\n\nThe 1996 law also created a new program, the National Child Care Information and Technical Assistance System (NCCITAS), which provided grants to states to help them develop and improve their child care systems. The law also created a new program, the National Family Support Initiative (NFSI), which provided grants to states to help them develop and implement family support programs.\n\nThe 1996 law also made significant changes to the Medicaid program, including the creation of the Medicaid Expansion Program (MEP), which provided states with the option to expand Medicaid eligibility to low-income adults who did not have dependent children. The law also created the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which provided grants to states to help them provide health insurance to uninsured children.\n\nThe 1996 welfare reform law was a significant change in the way the federal government approached poverty and welfare policy. It sought to promote work and self-sufficiency by providing a combination of cash assistance, work requirements, and work-related services. The law also made significant changes to the Medicaid and child care programs, which aimed to improve the health and well-being of low-income families.",

The river's water is managed by the federal government through the Bureau of Reclamation, which operates facilities and programs to provide water for irrigation, municipal use, and recreation. The river's water is apportioned among the seven states that share its waters through the Colorado River Compact of 1922, which was later modified by the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 and the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. The river's water supply has been affected by climate change, drought, and population growth, leading to increased competition among users and the need for additional water storage and conservation measures.",

Reclamation's primary mission is to provide water for irrigation, municipal, and industrial uses, as well as for hydroelectric power generation. Reclamation's projects are primarily funded through appropriations from Congress, and the agency has a long history of working with local governments and water districts to develop and implement water supply projects.\n\nReclamation's projects are typically funded through a combination of federal appropriations and non-federal contributions, such as local matching funds or grants from other federal agencies. The agency has a variety of funding mechanisms, including direct appropriations, reimbursable contracts, and loans.\n\nReclamation's funding is subject to annual appropriations from Congress, which can be influenced by a variety of factors, including political priorities, budget constraints, and competing demands for federal resources. The agency's funding has been subject to significant fluctuations in recent years, with some years seeing significant increases in funding and other years seeing decreases or flat funding.\n\nIn addition to its traditional water supply and infrastructure projects, Reclamation has also been involved in a number of other programs and initiatives, including water reuse and recycling, water conservation, and environmental restoration. The agency has also played a role in developing and implementing water management strategies in response to drought and other water-related challenges.\n\nReclamation's funding is primarily derived from appropriations from Congress, which are subject to annual appropriations processes.

Cleanup at these sites is governed by 72 agreements, including 12 federal facility agreements and 60 state and federal compliance agreements.

    "gao_GAO-18-486": "\nThe federal-state Unemployment Insurance (UI) program provides temporary cash benefits to eligible workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. The program is funded primarily through state payroll taxes on employers and administered by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The federal government provides grants to states to help fund reemployment services and eligibility assessments.\n\nWork search requirements are a key component of the UI program. Federal law requires states to have work search requirements as a condition of eligibility for UI benefits. States have considerable flexibility in determining the specific work search activities that claimants must engage in and the frequency with which they must do so.\n\nDOL uses its Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) system to determine the accuracy of UI payments. BAM involves reviewing a sample of UI claims to determine whether claimants complied with work search requirements and whether the state made improper payments. BAM also helps states identify areas where they can improve their UI programs.\n\nDOL has identified work search overpayments as a significant issue in the UI program. In fiscal year 2017, states made an estimated $1.36 billion in work search overpayments. Factors contributing to this issue include states' inability to verify claimants' work search activities and claimants' failure to comply with work search requirements.\n\nTo address work search overpayments, DOL has encouraged states to investigate more claims and to use formal warning systems to inform claimants of their noncompliance with work search requirements. DOL has also provided guidance on how states can improve their work search verification processes.\n\nIn summary, the UI program provides temporary cash benefits to eligible workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. States have considerable flexibility in determining work search requirements, but work search overpayments remain a significant issue in the program.

The DOD is required to report annually to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the compliance of its public water systems with these regulations.\n\nThe DOD has not consistently reported all violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act to the EPA, as required by DOD policy. In addition, the DOD has not used available data to identify differences in the types of violations between its public water systems that provide DOD-treated water and those that provide non-DOD-treated water.\n\nThe DOD has identified 77 military installations with at least one violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act during the period of 2013-2015.
