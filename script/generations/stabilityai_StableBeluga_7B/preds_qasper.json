The person variable could be any of the ten names of each gender (five for males and five for females) and the emotion word variable could be any of the four basic emotions (anger, fear, joy, or sadness) or any of the four basic situations (joy, sadness, anger, or fear). The sentences were generated by replacing the person and emotion word variables with the values they could take.",

Offensive language detection (Level A): Determines whether a tweet is offensive or not.\n2. Categorization of offensive language (Level B): Classifies the type of offense (targeted or untargeted) in the tweet.\n3. Offensive language target identification (Level C): Identifies the target of the offensive language in the tweet (individual, group, or other).",

When comparing the error generation system by Felice2014a (FY14) with our pattern-based (PAT) and machine translation (MT) approaches, we see that the latter methods covering all error types consistently improve performance. Combining the pattern-based approach with the machine translation system (Ann+PAT+MT) gave the best overall performance on all datasets.",

Copy-marked: another way to integrate copies without having to deal with OOVs is to augment the source vocabulary with a copy of the target vocabulary.\n3. Copy-dummies: a way to simulate data by replacing the OOVs with dummy words.",
