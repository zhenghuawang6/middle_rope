The IDFC will consolidate and expand the functions of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and will have the authority to make loans, issue guarantees, and provide insurance in local currencies. The IDFC will also conduct feasibility studies and provide technical assistance. The IDFC is expected to be operational by the end of 2023. The BUILD Act, which established the IDFC, was passed in October 2018 as part of the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act. The IDFC will have a significant role in responding to China's growing economic influence in developing countries through its development finance activities.",
    "crs_R44668": "\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was created in 1996 as a replacement for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, which had been in place since the 1930s. The 1996 welfare reform law aimed to promote work and self-sufficiency among single mothers and reduce dependence on cash assistance. The law changed the focus of welfare programs from providing assistance to promoting work and self-sufficiency. The law also established a time limit of 60 months for cash assistance and required recipients to engage in work activities. The law also provided funding for the TANF program through 2002, with extensions since then. The report provides a brief history of the AFDC program and the welfare reform debates of the 1960s to the 1990s, and a summary of the 1996 welfare reform law and its extensions.",
    "crs_R45546": "\nThe Colorado River Basin covers 246,000 square miles and is used for agriculture, municipal and industrial purposes, and power generation. The river is managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, which serves as water master on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior. The basin has a significant role in the U.S. economy, with 40 million people relying on its water supplies. The Law of the River, which includes the Colorado River Compact and other agreements, governs the basin's management. The compact apportions water between the Upper and Lower Basin, with the Lower Basin receiving more water. The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 authorized the construction of Hoover Dam and other facilities to manage the river's water. The Arizona v. California case in 1963 established the Secretary of the Interior's role as water master for the Lower Basin and set water allocations for the basin states. The 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty and subsequent legislation, such as the Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956 and the Central Arizona Project Act of 1968, have also played a significant role in managing the basin's water resources.",
    "crs_R45732": "\nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows plaintiffs to sue the United States for certain types of torts committed by federal employees. The FTCA waives the government's sovereign immunity, allowing plaintiffs to recover damages from the government. However, the FTCA also includes several limitations on damages and procedural requirements. The FTCA was enacted to ensure that persons injured by the actions of federal employees receive compensation and justice. The FTCA also aims to deter federal employees from engaging in tortious behavior and to protect the financial solvency of the government. The FTCA does not create a new federal cause of action against the government, but rather waives the government's sovereign immunity for certain types of tort claims. The FTCA also includes provisions that limit the government's liability and the forum in which tort claims can be brought.",

It also provides an overview of historical funding trends for CJS. The report is divided into two parts. The first part provides an overview of the annual CJS appropriations act and the agencies and bureaus funded under it. The second part provides a detailed breakdown of the FY2019 appropriations for each agency and bureau within the CJS. The report notes that the dollar amounts provided are only new funding made available at the start of the fiscal year and do not include any rescissions of unobligated or deobligated balances that may be counted as offsets to newly enacted appropriations, nor does it include any scorekeeping adjustments.",
    "crs_RS21212": "\nThe USDA offers several programs to help farmers and ranchers recover from the financial effects of natural disasters. These programs include federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), disaster assistance for livestock and fruit trees, and emergency loans for both crop and livestock producers. All of these programs have permanent authorization, except for the emergency loans, which require a federal disaster designation. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 made several changes to these programs, including expanding availability and increasing support. In addition, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 authorized $2.36 billion for disaster assistance for hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 that were not covered by existing programs.",
    "crs_RL30478": "\nThis report provides an overview of the various federal programs and projects that have been established to assist communities with water supply and wastewater treatment. The report focuses on the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The report describes the purposes, financing mechanisms, eligibility requirements, recent funding, and statutory/regulatory authority for each program. The report also highlights the differences between the programs and how they address water supply and wastewater treatment issues. The report does not address special programs aimed at assisting Indian Tribes, Alaskan Native Villages, or other regional programs such as those associated with the Appalachian region or U.S. Territories. The report emphasizes that federal funding for water and wastewater infrastructure has eroded over time, and alternative financing approaches, such as public-private partnerships, are being considered to supplement traditional funding sources.",
    "crs_RL32665": "\nThe report presents background information and issues concerning the Navy's force structure and shipbuilding plans. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's proposed FY2020 shipbuilding program and the Navy's longer-term shipbuilding plans. The report also covers the 355-ship force-structure goal, which was established in 2016 as a result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA). The new FSA is currently underway, and it could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both.

The Navy has been carrying out IW and CT activities in the Middle East and Afghanistan, including security force assistance, civic assistance, disaster relief, and counter-piracy operations. The Navy also has individual augmentees (IAs) serving in various capacities, including as part of special operations forces. The Navy has been involved in several high-profile CT operations, including the raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. The Navy also has detained terrorist suspects on its ships and has used interrogation techniques that have been controversial. The Navy's IW and CT operations are likely to continue, and Congress will need to consider how to fund and oversee these activities in the future.",
    "gao_GAO-19-207": "\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) oversees a nationwide complex of 16 sites that were created during World War II and the Cold War to research, produce, and test nuclear weapons. The cleanup of these sites, which contain vast quantities of radioactive and hazardous materials, is ongoing and has been carried out by the DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM) since 1989. The cleanup work is governed by a complex web of agreements and administrative steps that involve multiple laws, agencies, and administrative steps. EM has spent over $170 billion on the cleanup since it began, but the most challenging and costly work remains. EM manages its cleanup program based on internal guidance, milestones committed to regulators, and consultation with various stakeholders. However, EM lacks a standard definition of milestones, which makes it difficult to manage the cleanup program and monitor its progress.",
    "gao_GAO-18-486": "\nThe federal-state Unemployment Insurance (UI) program provides temporary cash benefits to eligible workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. The program is administered by the states according to federal requirements and with the oversight of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). States are responsible for funding the program through payroll taxes on employers and administering the program with a certain level of autonomy. Individuals typically file claims for UI benefits by submitting weekly or bi-weekly claims online or by phone. In fiscal year 2017, the average weekly UI benefit was about $350, and claimants remained on the program for an average of 15 weeks.\n\nWork search requirements are a condition of eligibility for UI benefits in most states. Federal law requires claimants to actively seek work, but states have some discretion in defining what constitutes \"actively seeking work.\" States may direct claimants to register for work with their state's Employment Service and may require them to participate in reemployment services. DOL provides grants to states to fund these services.\n\nThe BAM system is used by states to determine the accuracy of UI benefit payments. States review a sample of UI claims to ensure that benefits were paid correctly. If a claimant is found to have not met work search requirements, an overpayment may be established, and the claimant may be required to repay the overpayment.\n\nImproper payments, including overpayments, are a significant issue for the UI program. The leading cause of improper payments is overpayments to claimants who fail to meet work search requirements. In fiscal year 2017, states made an estimated $1.36 billion in work search overpayments. States use various methods to recover overpayments, including setting up payment plans, offsetting UI benefits, or deducting the overpayment from future benefits.",
    "gao_GAO-19-220": "\nThe U.S. State Department is responsible for implementing American foreign policy and representing the United States abroad. The department has five career tracks for Foreign Service employees: consular, economic, management, political, and public diplomacy. Foreign Service employees may be assigned to overseas posts or to headquarters in Washington, D.C. The department groups countries of the world into areas of responsibility under six geographic regional bureaus. State maintains personnel data on State employees in its GEMS database, which includes information on Foreign Service and Civil Service positions. According to State officials, State's ability to hire Foreign Service employees to fill persistent vacancies has been affected by factors such as reduced appropriations. State's data show persistent vacancies in both generalist and specialist positions at overseas posts. State officials report that some vacant specialist positions are more difficult to fill than others because candidates often possess skills in fields that are highly sought after in the private sector. State's data also show that overseas posts with the highest percentages of vacancies are in regions with heightened security risks that could threaten U.S. foreign policy interests.",
    "gao_GAO-19-148": "\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for managing and disposing of real properties through its three administrations - Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. Various VA offices share responsibilities for managing and disposing of real properties, including VHA's Office of Capital Asset Management, Engineering, and Support, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, and Office of Asset Enterprise Management.\n\nVA's disposal process begins with VHA and local medical facilities identifying underutilized properties and updating information in the CAI database. VA then prioritizes disposal options and chooses from various methods such as enhanced-use leases, demolition, like-kind exchanges, transfer to state nursing homes, or declaring excess property for disposal through the General Services Administration (GSA). The disposal process differs based on the chosen method.\n\nFrom fiscal years 2012 to 2017, VA disposed of 471 buildings through demolition or enhanced-use leases. The majority of the buildings were offices, housing quarters, service buildings, and warehouses. VA is addressing challenges in environmental and historic reviews, marketability of properties, and competing priorities for funding. VA has taken steps to reduce the time it takes to conduct environmental and historic reviews and has established a working group to assist with disposal processes.",
    "gao_GAO-18-271": "\nThe report discusses the processing of imported goods in the United States, which is facilitated and enforced by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency in collaboration with other federal agencies and companies. The report highlights the three stages of imported goods processing: pre-arrival, arrival/cargo release, and post-release. CBP initiated planning and development of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) in 1994, which was intended to be a national customs automation program to facilitate electronic processing of imports and exports. However, the implementation of ACE has been plagued with difficulties, and the completion of its core capabilities has been delayed several times.

    "gao_GAO-18-420": "\nThe federal government is the largest real property owner in the United States, with a vast inventory of buildings that require operation and maintenance. The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for designing, constructing, and managing these buildings for other federal agencies and the judiciary. The Design Excellence Program was established in 1994 to improve the design of federal courthouses and office buildings. The program emphasizes designing spaces that reflect the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the U.S. government, avoid uniformity, and are built in locations that integrate with the surrounding public spaces. The program also aims to reduce long-term operational and maintenance (O&M) costs by selecting materials and designs that are durable, low-maintenance, and energy-efficient. However, a review of 78 Design Excellence buildings found that some design choices, such as multistory atriums and custom windows, increased O&M costs, while others, like natural lighting and native landscaping, reduced costs. GSA does not fully consider the O&M costs and functionality of design choices during the planning and design stages of new buildings.",

The committee is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes representatives from several other government agencies. CFIUS has the authority to investigate and block foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies if they pose a threat to national security. The process for reviewing transactions notified to CFIUS consists of four stages: pre-notice consultation, national security review, national security investigation, and presidential action. CFIUS has the power to request information from parties involved in a transaction and to initiate investigations on its own initiative. The committee's authority is not limited to transactions that have been notified to it, and it may investigate non-notified transactions if it has reason to believe they pose a risk to national security.",
