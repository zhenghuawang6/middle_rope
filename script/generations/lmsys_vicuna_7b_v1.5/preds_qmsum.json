The User Interface preferred a more standard, boring design, possibly because they believed it would be easier for users to understand and use. The Industrial Designer, on the other hand, seemed to be more interested in creating a unique and visually appealing design. Ultimately, the decision was left up to the team, and they decided to stick with a more standard design with the possibility of adding a rubber case to make it more comfortable to hold.",
