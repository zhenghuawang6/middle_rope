Grammatical correctness: The sentences must be grammatically correct and well-formed.\n2. Linguistic diversity: The sentences must be representative of a wide range of linguistic features, such as sentence structure, vocabulary, and syntax.\n3. Emotional diversity: The sentences must express a range of emotions, including positive, negative, and neutral emotions.\n4. Gender and racial diversity: The sentences must be representative of a diverse range of genders and races.\n5. Real-world relevance: The sentences must be relevant to real-world situations and experiences.\n\nBy selecting sentences that meet these criteria, the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC) aims to provide a diverse and representative dataset for evaluating the fairness of natural language processing systems.",

For each word, the polarity score is calculated using the following formula:\n\npolarity score = (number of positive contexts) - (number of negative contexts)\n\nwhere the number of positive and negative contexts are determined based on the labels of the contexts in which the word appears. The labels can be either positive, negative, or neutral. The formula is based on the idea that words with more positive contexts should have a higher polarity score, and words with more negative contexts should have a lower polarity score.",

However, based on the context of the article and the task of diacritic restoration, some possible linguistic features that might be used in the diacritizer include:\n\n1. Morphological features: The article mentions the use of a morphological analyzer to generate all possible out-of-context diacritizations of a word. This suggests that morphological features, such as the root of the word, its pattern of inflection, and its grammatical case, might be used in the diacritizer.\n2. Phonological features: The article mentions the use of a biLSTM recurrent neural network to model the diacritization problem. This suggests that phonological features, such as the sound patterns of the word and its position in the sentence, might be used in the diacritizer.\n3. Syntactic features: The article mentions the use of a rich set of surface, morphological, and syntactic features to capture syntactic dependencies indicated by POS tags, gender and number features, morphological patterns, and affixes. This suggests that syntactic features, such as the word's part of speech, its gender and number, and its grammatical relationships with other words in the sentence, might be used in the diacritizer.\n4. Contextual features: The article mentions the use of a unigram language model for post-correction. This suggests that contextual features, such as the word's context and the surrounding words, might be used in the diacritizer.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific features used in the diacritizer may depend on the specific task and the desired level of accuracy. The article does not provide a comprehensive list of features, but rather highlights the use of a combination of linguistic features to improve the accuracy of the diacritizer.",
