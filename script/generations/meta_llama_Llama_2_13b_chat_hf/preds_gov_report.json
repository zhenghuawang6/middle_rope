    "crs_R45461": "\nThe U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) is a new government agency that aims to mobilize private sector capital and skills to support economic development in developing and transition countries. The IDFC is the successor to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and it has a broader mandate to support development projects in a more comprehensive and strategic way. The IDFC will have the authority to provide loans, guarantees, and political risk insurance to support private sector investments in developing countries, and it will be able to invest in a wider range of sectors, including infrastructure, renewable energy, and agriculture. The IDFC will also have a stronger focus on transparency and accountability, and it will be required to report regularly to Congress on its activities and progress.\n\nThe IDFC is a significant development in U.S. foreign assistance policy, as it represents a new approach to supporting economic development in developing countries. By mobilizing private sector capital and skills, the IDFC aims to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty in these countries. The IDFC also reflects a shift in U.S. foreign assistance policy towards a more comprehensive and strategic approach to development, which emphasizes the importance of private sector engagement and partnership.\n\nOverall, the IDFC has the potential to make a positive impact on economic development in developing countries, and it represents a significant step forward in U.S. foreign assistance policy. However, the success of the IDFC will depend on a number of factors, including its ability to attract private sector investment, its effectiveness in promoting sustainable economic growth, and its accountability and transparency.",

It also summarizes the 1996 welfare reform law and the changes made since 1996. The report concludes with a detailed chronology of TANF legislation.\n\nThe AFDC program was created in the 1930s to provide financial assistance to families with children who were \"deprived of parental support or care\" due to the death, absence, or incapacity of a parent. Over time, the program's goals and eligibility requirements have changed, and it has been renamed several times. In 1996, the AFDC program was replaced by the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, which gave states more flexibility in designing their own welfare programs.\n\nSince 1996, there have been several changes to TANF policy, including the creation of the JOBS program, the expansion of eligibility for two-parent families, and the establishment of time-limited transitional child care. The TANF Extension Act of 2019 extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019.\n\nThe chronology of TANF legislation includes the following key dates:\n\n* 1935: The Social Security Act created the ADC program to provide financial assistance to families with children who were \"deprived of parental support or care.\"\n* 1960s-1970s: Proposals to replace AFDC with a negative income tax or guaranteed income were introduced but not enacted.\n* 1980s: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 limited the earnings disregard for AFDC recipients and gave states expanded authority to require community service or work experience programs.\n* 1996: The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) replaced AFDC with the TANF block grant and established the JOBS program.\n* 2002: The TANF reauthorization extended funding and financing authority for TANF through FY2007.\n* 2006, 2010, and 2012: TANF reauthorizations extended funding and financing authority through FY2012, FY2016, and FY2019, respectively.\n* 2019: The TANF Extension Act extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019.",
