The IDFC is a successor to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and will consolidate and expand the U.S. government's existing development finance functions. The IDFC will have the authority to make loans and guarantees, issue insurance or reinsurance, and take minority equity positions in investments, subject to limitations. The IDFC will also be able to issue loans in local currency. The BUILD Act, which established the IDFC, also specifies that certain functions of USAID will be transferred to the IDFC, but the extent of these transfers is not yet clear. The IDFC represents a significant overhaul of U.S. development finance efforts and is intended to be a response to China's growing economic influence in developing countries.",
    "crs_R44668": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was established in 1996 as a replacement for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. TANF was created as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) which aimed to overhaul cash assistance programs for needy families with children. The AFDC program had a long history dating back to the New Deal era and had evolved over time to include various social services and benefits. The welfare reform debates of the 1960s to the 1990s focused on issues of work and the role of cash assistance in disincentivizing work and marriage. The TANF program has been the subject of several legislative extensions since its creation, with most extensions not making any changes to the program's policy. The TANF Extension Act of 2019 extended the program's funding through June 30, 2019.",

The federal government, through the Bureau of Reclamation, plays a significant role in managing the basin's water, with the Lower Basin also being served as the water master on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior. Climate change impacts, including warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, may exacerbate the current drought in the basin. The management of the Colorado River is guided by the Law of the River, which includes the Colorado River Compact and subsequent agreements and court decisions. Congress has a significant role in the management of basin water, funding and overseeing the Bureau of Reclamation's management of Colorado River Basin facilities, and considering Indian water rights settlements, new water storage, and drought mitigation measures.",
    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows plaintiffs to file and prosecute certain types of tort lawsuits against the United States, potentially recovering financial compensation from the federal government. The FTCA was enacted to address the issue of sovereign immunity, which prevented plaintiffs from suing the federal government for tortious actions committed by its employees or officers. The FTCA waives the government's immunity from certain types of tort claims, but it also comes with significant costs, including the potential for the government to spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually to pay tort claims. The FTCA also includes various procedural requirements that plaintiffs must comply with before filing suit. The FTCA has been amended several times over the years to address various issues, and there have been proposals to further amend the act.",

These programs include federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), livestock and fruit tree disaster programs, and emergency disaster loans for both crop and livestock producers. Most of these programs have permanent authorization and receive mandatory funding, while the emergency loan program requires a federal disaster designation. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 made several amendments to these programs to expand availability and support. Prior to the creation of permanent programs, Congress provided ad hoc disaster assistance through supplemental appropriations. Recently, policies have shifted to supplement permanent programs with ad hoc assistance for select agricultural losses.",

The current and planned size and composition of the Navy, the rate of Navy ship procurement, and the prospective affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plans have been oversight matters for the congressional defense committees for many years. The report covers the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's proposed FY2020 shipbuilding program and the Navy's longer-term shipbuilding plans. Decisions that Congress makes on this issue can substantially affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements, and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base.",

These operations have included security force assistance, civic assistance, disaster relief, and counter-piracy operations. The Navy has also provided individual augmentees (IAs) to support these operations. The Navy's focus on irregular warfare and counterterrorism has raised concerns about the balance between these operations and other naval capabilities, such as high-end combat capabilities. The Navy's budget request for FY2020 includes funding for irregular warfare and counterterrorism operations, as well as for high-end combat capabilities. Congress will need to consider the balance between these priorities in its budget decisions.",
    "gao_GAO-19-207": "\nThe report discusses the cleanup of nuclear waste sites managed by the Department of Energy's (EM) Office of Environmental Management (EM). EM oversees a nationwide complex of 16 sites that were created during World War II and the Cold War to research, produce, and test nuclear weapons. The complex still contains vast quantities of radioactive and hazardous materials related to the production of nuclear weapons. EM began cleanup activities in 1989 and has spent over $170 billion on the cleanup program. The cleanup process is complicated and involves multiple laws, agencies, and administrative steps. EM's cleanup responsibilities derive from different laws, including CERCLA, RCRA, the Atomic Energy Act, and state hazardous waste laws. Federal facility agreements, compliance orders, and other compliance agreements govern the cleanup. These agreements may include milestones, which are dates by which DOE commits to plan and carry out its cleanup work at the sites. However, EM lacks a standard definition of milestones, which limits its ability to monitor performance and manage the cleanup program effectively.",
    "gao_GAO-18-486": "\nThe federal-state Unemployment Insurance (UI) program provides temporary cash benefits to eligible workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and funded primarily through state payroll taxes on employers. The states have considerable flexibility to set benefit amounts and duration, as well as eligibility requirements. UI benefits are paid to eligible claimants who file claims with their state UI agency on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. In fiscal year 2017, the average weekly UI benefit was about $350, and claimants remained on the program for an average of 15 weeks.\n\nWork search requirements are a condition of eligibility for UI benefits. Federal law establishes a work search requirement, but the specific activities required vary by state. States must have laws that require UI claimants to actively seek work as a condition of eligibility for benefits. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required states to have work search requirements specified in their laws as a condition of receiving UI administrative grants. States have some discretion to establish a reasonable definition of actively seeking work, but the specific activities that are acceptable as work search activities vary by state.\n\nThe DOL uses the Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) system to determine the accuracy of UI benefit payments and estimate the amount and rate of improper payments. Each state reviews a number of randomly selected cases on a weekly basis and reconstructs the UI claims process to assess the accuracy of the payments made. The BAM program assigns one of three classifications to each work search activity reviewed: acceptable, unverifiable, or unacceptable. Acceptable or unverifiable activities may be considered in calculating whether the claimant has satisfied the state\u2019s required number of work search activities for BAM purposes. If the state investigator finds that the claimant\u2019s work search is unacceptable and does not meet the state\u2019s requirements, he or she may determine that the claimant was ineligible for benefits and establish an overpayment, depending on state law.\n\nThe leading reported cause of UI improper payments in fiscal year 2017 was overpayments to claimants who failed to meet work search requirements. States made an estimated $1.36 billion in such overpayments in fiscal year 2017. Other major causes of UI improper payments included payments made to claimants who continued to make claims even after returning to work and payments made to claimants who were determined ineligible due to disqualifying job separations.\n\nCertain state administrative practices, including investigating a higher percentage of claimant-reported work search activities and frequent use of formal warnings, were associated with lower reported state work search overpayment rates. However, federal law does not permit states to warn claimants the first time they fail to meet work search requirements instead of establishing that an overpayment was made. A higher percentage of claimants required to search for work is associated with higher reported state work search overpayment rates.",

    "gao_GAO-19-148": "The report provides an overview of the responsibilities and processes involved in disposing of real properties owned by the Veterans Administration (VA). The VA has three distinct administrations: Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. VHA is responsible for overseeing health care delivery to enrolled veterans and managing all VA medical facilities. The Office of Capital Asset Management, Engineering, and Support is responsible for supporting property disposal efforts of VISNs and local facilities, including providing funding for demolitions. The Office of Construction and Facilities Management is responsible for developing and updating policies and procedures on disposal actions, coordinating the Steward B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act\u2019s screening process, and overseeing implementation of required federal environmental reviews. The Office of Asset Enterprise Management is responsible for ensuring local facility disposal requests align with VA policy, reviewing real-property inventory data, monitoring completion of disposal projects, executing enhanced-use lease-related disposals, and overseeing the Strategic Capital Investment Planning process.\n\nVA has identified and prioritized disposal options for VISNs and local facilities to determine what to do with vacant and underutilized properties they have identified. VA's first priority is to reuse vacant and underutilized properties within the department. If properties cannot be reused, then VA looks at disposal options that would remove them from its inventory. VA may choose from several options to dispose of vacant and underutilized properties, including entering into an enhanced-use lease, demolition, like-kind exchange, transfer of real properties to the state for nursing home use, declaring excess property for disposals through GSA, or mothballing, among others. The disposal process differs depending on the disposal method selected.\n\nFrom fiscal years 2012 through 2017, VA disposed of 577 properties, primarily through demolition of medical facilities and enhanced-use lease agreements. These two methods accounted for the disposal of 3.6 million gross square feet of building space. VA used other disposal methods, such as transferring property to states for nursing home care or negotiating a sale, for the remaining 50 properties. As of July 2018, VA reported initiating the disposal or reuse of 167 of the 430 vacant buildings the Secretary identified for disposal in June 2017.\n\nVA officials and stakeholders cited administering both environmental and historic reviews as key challenges for disposals. Other ongoing challenges include the marketability of VA properties and prioritizing funding for disposals. VA has begun addressing these challenges by establishing a working group to assist VISNs and local facilities in conducting environmental and historic reviews, awarding regional contracts with contractors to complete the environmental and historic reviews and expedite the disposal process, and developing a toolkit to improve collaboration and communication between VA and external stakeholders.",

    "gao_GAO-18-78": "\nThe report discusses the regulation and compliance of drinking water systems in military installations by the Department of Defense (DOD). DOD has two types of public water systems that provide drinking water to people living and working on military installations. The first type provides drinking water that has been treated by DOD, while the second type provides water treated by a private company or a local utility, which is referred to as \u201cnon-DOD-treated\u201d drinking water. Drinking water systems vary in size and other factors, but they typically include a supply source, treatment facility, and distribution system. EPA regulates drinking water contaminants under the Safe Drinking Water Act by issuing legally enforceable standards, known as National Primary Drinking Water Regulations, which limit the levels of these contaminants in public water systems. EPA may also take emergency actions necessary to protect public health when informed that a contaminant is present in or is likely to enter a public water system or an underground source of drinking water that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment. DOD\u2019s environmental compliance policy requires the military departments to annually report to ASD (EI&E) the total population receiving water from both \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cother\u201d DOD public water systems that provide DOD- and non-DOD-treated drinking water, respectively, that did and did not attain all Safe Drinking Water Act health-based drinking water standards.

    "gao_GAO-18-249": "The CFIUS was established in 1975 to monitor and coordinate U.S. policy on foreign investment in the United States. The Exon-Florio amendment in 1988 authorized the President to investigate the impact of certain foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security and to suspend or prohibit acquisitions that might threaten national security. FINSA in 1992 further amended the Defense Production Act and established CFIUS as it currently exists. The committee is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes members from various government agencies. CFIUS reviews transactions involving a variety of countries and industry sectors to determine if they pose a threat to national security. The committee has three core functions: reviewing transactions, monitoring compliance with mitigation measures, and identifying transactions of concern. CFIUS may also solicit perspectives and expertise from non-member agencies. Parties to a transaction are not required to notify CFIUS, but CFIUS may initiate a review of any covered transaction. The CFIUS process for reviewing notified transactions includes pre-notice consultation, national security review, national security investigation, and presidential action. The committee's determination must be certified to specified members of Congress after the review is completed. If the committee concludes that a proposed foreign investment threatens to impair U.S. national security and the threat cannot be mitigated, CFIUS will elevate the notice to the President for determination.",

One of the top three priorities is to reduce demand for illegally traded wildlife, which includes raising public awareness of the harms of wildlife trafficking and enlisting individual consumers in the fight through education and outreach. The Implementation Plan designates various U.S. agencies to lead or participate in achieving the strategic priority of reducing demand for illegally traded wildlife. Since September 2016, U.S. agencies and global stakeholders have taken a range of actions to address wildlife trafficking issues, including the passage of the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt (END) Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 and China's closure of its domestic ivory market. The United Nations estimates that the global scale of illegal wildlife trade is between $7 billion and $23 billion annually, with environmental crime increasing by 26 percent since 2014.
