    "va-sq-11": "The Industrial Designer disagreed with the User Interface when discussing the shape of the remote control because the User Interface wanted a more organic and fruit-like shape, while the Industrial Designer believed that a more conventional and functional design would be better suited for the remote control.",
    "va-sq-50": "The discussion in the meeting revolved around the design of the industrial components of the remote control. The team discussed the use of different materials such as plastic, rubber, and titanium for the design. They also talked about the use of push buttons or liquid crystal display (LCD) for the user interface. The team decided to go with simple push buttons and speech recognition technology to reduce costs. They also discussed the use of batteries and the limitations of solar cells. The team agreed to go with lightweight batteries and considered the use of nickel or alkaline batteries.",
    "va-sq-57": "The marketing team learned that the remote control concept needs to be designed with a focus on cost reduction and simplicity. They discussed the use of simple push buttons instead of a liquid crystal display (LCD) and considered using a speaker independent technology for speech recognition. The team also discussed the use of lightweight batteries and the limitations of double-curved shapes in manufacturing.",
    "va-sq-58": "The discussion in the meeting revolved around the appearance design of the remote control. The team discussed the use of different materials such as plastic, rubber, and titanium, and the possibility of using double-curved shapes. They also talked about the cost implications of using different materials and the difficulty of manufacturing buttons and other parts. Ultimately, the team decided to go with a simple push-button design and to include speech recognition technology to reduce costs.",
    "va-gq-66": "The meeting was a detailed design meeting where the team presented the prototype, evaluated criteria, and discussed finance. The prototype was based on the shape of a banana, and the user interface included buttons, scrolling, and a spinning wheel. The team also discussed adding a mute button and voice recognition feature. The meeting ended with a brief evaluation of the production and design process.",
    "va-gq-93": "The meeting was a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. The early implementer local authority areas have gone well, but there have been challenges with bureaucracy, communication, and the administrative burden on local authorities.

    "va-sq-108": "Kirsty Williams mentioned that there is still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, although there has been a trend of filling the places for secondary school training at Welsh teacher training centres. She mentioned that they are making sure that their ITE provision is world-class, and they are offering financial incentives for graduates with the highest levels of qualifications to teach in priority subjects. They are also embarking on a national ITE recruitment marketing exercise to attract people to become teachers. Additionally, they have set up an advisory board to look into the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and they are awaiting reports from that board to determine what they should do next.",

    "va-sq-145": "The product manager wants to achieve the expected profit by designing a new television remote control that is original, trendy, and modern, and has the right buttons in the right place. The project will go through three stages: functional, conceptual, and detailed design. The team will work individually, present their ideas, and then move into the next phase. The project manager will show the team the tools they have available, such as the Smartboard and the project management and project document folders, which work the same as on a computer. The team can use the Smartboard to draw, save their work, and not throw anything away.",
    "va-gq-166": "The meeting discussed the progress of various projects, including the TORRENT chip, Aurora stuff, and mean subtraction approach. There were also discussions about the use of SRI recognizer and Macrophone set of read speech. The team members shared their ideas and plans for improving the performance of their respective projects.",
    "va-sq-179": "Marketing discussed market trend findings related to younger people's preferences for soft mat materials, primary colors, and curved and round shapes for remote controls. They also talked about the importance of making the remote control easy to use and recognizable.",
    "va-sq-184": "The government's plan towards structural change in the higher education sector is to ensure that institutions are alert to the challenges they are facing and engaging with those challenges properly. There is a managed situation, and while there are acute challenges, there is no immediate risk of institutions falling over. However, if the pressure continues unabated, more costs may be taken out, leading to more job losses and capacity loss. The government is also exploring the possibility of structural change within the sector as a solution, but it is not a policy position, and it is not always a good short-term response to crisis.",
    "va-sq-186": "The solution to risk appetite was not mentioned in the transcript provided.",
    "va-sq-216": "The Industrial Designer thought that the appearance design of the remote control should be child-friendly and colorful, and they suggested that it could change colors like phones. They also mentioned that it should be waterproof and baby-proof.",

    "va-sq-264": "The team discussed the design of a new remote control that needs to be original, trendy, and user-friendly. They agreed to make a functional design first, followed by a conceptual design and a detailed design. The remote control should have big buttons for easy use, and it should be lightweight and durable. The team also discussed the idea of adding an LED on the corner of the remote control to indicate that it's working. The remote control should be compatible with other products and have no battery use."
