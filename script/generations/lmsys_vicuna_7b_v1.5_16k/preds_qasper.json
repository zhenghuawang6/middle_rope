The sentences were generated by instantiating eleven sentence templates, which included variables for a person and an emotion word. The authors chose ten names of each gender from a study by Caliskan:2017 and selected emotion words from the categories in the Roget's Thesaurus corresponding to four emotions: anger, fear, joy, and sadness. The sentences were manually examined to ensure they were grammatically well-formed. The full set of 8,640 sentences is referred to as the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC).",
