    "crs_R44668": "\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program was created in 1996 as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). The program replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, which had been in place since the 1930s. The PRWORA provided both program authority and funding for TANF through 2002, and subsequent legislation has extended the program's funding and financing through 2019. The TANF program provides cash assistance to needy families with children, with the goal of promoting self-sufficiency and reducing dependency on government assistance. The program has undergone several changes since its inception, including the addition of work requirements and the creation of the JOBS Training program.",
    "crs_R45546": "\nThe Colorado River Basin covers 246,000 square miles and is home to 40 million people. The river is used for irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, power generation, and recreation. The river's flow and stored water are important for multiple uses, including fish and wildlife habitat, and the river is subject to drought and other environmental factors. The federal government plays a significant role in managing the river through the Bureau of Reclamation, which serves as water master on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 apportioned water between the Upper and Lower Basins, with the Lower Basin receiving 7.5 million acre-feet (MAF) per year and the Upper Basin receiving 7.5 MAF per year, with the ability to increase the Lower Basin's allocation by 1 MAF per year. The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 ratified the Colorado River Compact and authorized the construction of Hoover Dam and related facilities to deliver water to the Lower Basin. The Arizona v. California decision of 1963 established the priority of water deliveries to the Lower Basin and the role of the Secretary of the Interior as water master. The 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty established water allocations between the United States and Mexico. The Upper Basin Compact of 1948 established allocations among the Upper Basin states, with Colorado as the largest entitlement holder. The Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956 authorized storage reservoirs and dams in the Upper Basin, and the 1968 Colorado River Basin Project Act amended the act to provide for additional storage and conveyance facilities.",
    "crs_R45732": "\nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows plaintiffs to sue the United States for torts committed by federal employees. The FTCA waives the government's immunity from tort claims, but it does not create a new federal cause of action against the United States. The FTCA only applies to torts committed by federal employees, and it does not protect non-employees who commit torts. The FTCA also provides protections and benefits to the United States, such as limiting the fora in which a plaintiff may bring a tort suit against the government. The FTCA also shields federal employees from personal tort liability, except in certain circumstances.",
