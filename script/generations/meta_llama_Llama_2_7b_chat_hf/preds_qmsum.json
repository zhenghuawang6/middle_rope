    "va-sq-11": "The Industrial Designer disagreed with the User Interface when discussing the shape of the remote control because the User Interface preferred a more organic and sleek design, while the Industrial Designer preferred a more functional and practical design. The Industrial Designer believed that the remote control should be designed with a more traditional and familiar shape, while the User Interface wanted to explore more innovative and trendy options.",
    "va-sq-50": "The meeting transcript discusses the design of a remote control for a household device. The industrial designer presents several options for components, including batteries, buttons, and speech recognition technology. The team discusses the pros and cons of each option and decides to go with simple buttons and speech recognition technology to reduce costs. They also consider the location of the remote control in the household and the need for it to be findable by multiple people.",
    "va-sq-57": "The marketing learned that the trend is to use simple devices or simple technology for the location of the remote control in a room or house, and to reduce the cost of the technology.",
    "va-sq-58": "The meeting transcript discusses the appearance design of the remote control. The industrial designer presents several options for the remote control's appearance, including using titanium instead of rubber for the buttons, using push buttons instead of LCD displays, and using a simple battery instead of solar cells. The team also discusses the problem of manufacturing double-curved shapes and the cost of using rubber parts. The marketing manager suggests using small nickel or alkaline batteries for lightness and good price. The team also talks about the location of the remote control and how to define the speech recognition technology.",
    "va-gq-66": "The meeting was a detailed design meeting where the team presented their prototype and user interface design for the remote control. The team discussed the design and made some changes based on the feedback. They also went over the evaluation criteria and budget issues. The team members agreed to make some adjustments to the design to fit within the budget constraints.",
    "va-gq-93": "The meeting discussed the Welsh Government's childcare offer, specifically the early implementer areas and the challenges faced in the roll-out. The Minister for Children and Social Care, Huw Irranca-Davies, discussed the administrative burden on local authorities in administering the scheme, the intensity of demand for services, and the importance of quality in registered and licensed providers. The National Day Nurseries Association expressed concerns about the fragility of the childcare sector in Wales. The Minister also discussed the foundational economy approach and the 10-year workforce development plan for childcare. The meeting concluded that while there are challenges, the roll-out of the childcare offer will continue with \u00a360 million of capital money and a workforce development plan to address staffing issues.",
    "va-sq-108": "Kirsty Williams, the Cabinet Secretary for Education in Wales, discussed the trend of teacher recruiting in Wales during the meeting of the Children, Young People, and Education Committee. She mentioned that the trend is not unique to Wales and is a common issue across the globe. The reasons for the trend include a lack of attractiveness of teaching as a profession, financial incentives not being enough to encourage people to pursue teaching, and a shortage of employment-based routes into qualified teacher status.\n\nTo address the issue, Kirsty Williams mentioned that the Welsh government had set targets to increase the number of teachers trained in Welsh medium schools, and they were working closely with ITE centres to develop and agree upon minimum provision for Welsh language skills within ITE provision for all teachers. Additionally, they had introduced new financial incentives for people starting their course and for teachers who complete their QTS after a year.",
    "va-sq-117": "Eluned Morgan, the Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, believes that the issue of teacher pay is complex and requires a step change in order to meet the targets set for 2021. She acknowledges that the report published in September highlighted the need to double the number of teachers coming through the system, but notes that the current trends are not encouraging. Morgan suggests that the level of ambition and action needed to address the issue is not yet reflected in the answers given this morning.",
    "va-sq-125": "Vaughan Gething thought that the perinatal mental health service was \"part of the honest challenge\" and \"not fully understood\" during the pandemic, indicating that there may be a need for more support and understanding of the impact of the pandemic on perinatal mental health.",

    "va-gq-166": "The meeting discussed a project that has been ongoing for two years, with the goal of being two months away from being done. The project involves developing a chip called TORRENT. The team has been working on getting down to the nitty-gritty of the project, with some members working on writing proposals and others discussing the quals. The team also discussed the idea of using TIMIT for phone recognition and SRI recognizer for large vocabulary tasks. They also talked about mean subtraction approach, which showed an improvement in word error rate. Additionally, they discussed the idea of high-pass filtering to reduce the effects of reverberation.",
    "va-sq-179": "Marketing talked about market trend findings that younger people want soft mat materials and primary colors, like yellow, red, and curved and round shapes. They also mentioned that the younger generation likes the idea of a hand-shaped remote control with push-buttons and a scroll wheel for channels and volume.",
    "va-sq-184": "The government is not seeing a crisis, but rather challenging circumstances for institutions to manage. There is no policy position on structural change, but HEFCW is trying to make sure that institutions are aware of the challenges they face and are engaging with them properly. However, there is a possibility of structural change within the sector, which might be one of the solutions institutions think about, but it's not a good short-term response to crisis.",
    "va-sq-186": "The solution to risk appetite is not mentioned in the provided transcript. The discussion focused on the financial sustainability of higher education institutions in Wales, the impact of demographic changes, pension costs, and Brexit on the sector, and the measures being taken to address these challenges. However, there is no mention of risk appetite or any solution related to it.",
    "va-sq-216": "The Industrial Designer thought that the remote control for children should be colourful, and even suggested that it could change colours, as children like one colour and then change it.",
    "va-sq-219": "The target price, target cost and target profit of the remote control are not explicitly mentioned in the transcript. However, during the meeting, the project manager mentions that the project has a budget of \u00a350,000 and that they are aiming to make a profit of 20% on the project. This suggests that the target cost of the remote control is around \u00a340,000 (50,000 - 20,000) and the target profit is around \u00a38,000 (40,000 x 20%).",
    "va-sq-225": "The meeting transcript discusses the microphone data collected during a meeting. Grad E mentions that they have been collecting microphone data for a while and have around 20 minutes of data. PhD C mentions that they sent an email a few hours ago with a no-frills recognizer that is gender-dependent but has no adaptation, cross-word models, or trigrams, and is trained on Switchboard, which is telephone conversations. Don sampled the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and used the individual channels they segmented it into. There is a glitch in the middle of the recording, and the overall error rate when they first ran it was around 80%.",
    "va-sq-250": "The Prime Minister said that the government will continue to work with seasonal industries and different regions to make sure they have a sufficient workforce in their situation.

    "va-sq-264": "Based on the transcript, the decision of remote feature design is to make a new remote control that is not too heavy, has a few buttons, and has an LED on the corner to indicate when it's working. The remote control should also be compatible with other products and have a simple design. Additionally, the remote control should not use too many batteries and should be easy to use."
