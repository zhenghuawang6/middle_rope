When comparing the error generation system by Felice2014a (FY14) with our pattern-based (PAT) and machine translation (MT) approaches, we see that the latter methods covering all error types consistently improve performance. While the added error types tend to be less frequent and more complicated to capture, the added coverage is indeed beneficial for error detection. Combining the pattern-based approach with the machine translation system (Ann+PAT+MT) gave the best overall performance on all datasets. The two frameworks learn to generate different types of errors, and taking advantage of both leads to substantial improvements in error detection.",

    "3355918bbdccac644afe441f085d0ffbbad565d7": "The supervised scores of the words are calculated by using a machine learning algorithm called Support Vector Machines (SVM). SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. In the context of text classification, SVM is used to classify words into different categories based on their context and meaning.\n\nThe process of calculating the supervised scores of the words involves the following steps:\n\n1. Preprocessing the text data: The text data is first preprocessed to remove any stop words, punctuation, and other non-informative words. This helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the important words.\n\n2. Feature extraction: Feature extraction is the process of identifying the important features or characteristics of the words. In the context of text classification, these features could be the presence of certain words, their part of speech, or their position in the sentence.\n\n3. Vectorization: The extracted features are then vectorized, which means they are converted into numerical values. This is done by assigning a unique numerical value to each feature.\n\n4. Training the SVM model: The vectorized features are then used to train the SVM model. The SVM model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the words are already classified into different categories.\n\n5. Testing the SVM model: Once the SVM model is trained, it is tested on a separate test dataset to evaluate its performance. The test dataset should have words that are not present in the training dataset.\n\n6. Calculating the supervised scores: The SVM model is used to predict the category of each word in the test dataset. The predicted category for each word is then compared with the actual category to calculate the supervised scores. These scores indicate how well the SVM model has learned to classify the words into different categories.\n\nIn summary, the supervised scores of the words are calculated using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm, which is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. The SVM model is trained on a labeled dataset and tested on a separate test dataset to evaluate its performance in classifying the words into different categories.",

The translations were then reviewed and edited by experts in the field to ensure that they were accurate and culturally appropriate.",
